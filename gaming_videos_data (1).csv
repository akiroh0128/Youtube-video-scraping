recreated every single set from Squid Game in real life, and whichever one of these 456
people survives the longest, wins 456 grand. (contestants cheering) The first game we're gonna
play is red light, green light. They have 30 minutes to cross the red line on the other side of the huge room. So without further ado, green light. (tense music) Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh. And as you can see, every single player has a
device strapped to them, that when they're eliminated, it pops. Chris, you wanna have a chance at one? - Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh, no. - I know for sure this guy moved. Green light. - Red light. Oh yo, they're dropping. Okay, now some people are getting out. - You gotta get a better spot for the next red light, right? - Mmhmm. - You're fine. - 30 people have gotten out so far. If they move right now, they're out. They have to hold this position
until we say green light. And I can take all the time I want, 'cause we still have 23 minutes left. - We gotta get a green light going. This guy's doing a full squat. - Green light. Green light. Oh they all stopped. Red light. (gun shot)
Oh. - I called it, I called it. Oh no. - Can you push my glasses up? - Okay. - Do it slowly though, be careful. - Are you good? - Yeah, perfect.
- Okay. Green light. Red light. You're still moving. She was jogging over here. We're gonna go see who's in the very back. You are in dead last. What's going on? - I let the others clear the path for me. - You literally haven't even moved. - Well, a couple steps. - We'll see if it pans out, green light. Yellow, red light. Oh, that we got her,
the yellow light worked. - Oh, that was diabolical to
throw a yellow light out there. - Since 067 was a big part of the show. I'll let you say green light. - [All] Green light. - Red light, yo, it would be
funny if she just got out. As you can see, over 100
people have been eliminated. Do the honors, Chandler. - Green light, red light. (gun shot) - [Mr. Beast] Oh, that was a loud one. - There it is, ay. - Green light. Red light. Look how close they
are to the finish line. It is do or die for most of these people. Everyone look up at the TV. You have four minutes and 20 seconds left. - Yeah, that's the number. - Green light, red light. We have our first two finishers over here. - Lets go! - Green light, red light. - Yes sir, baby. Yes sir, baby. - [Mr. Beast] All right, we have five people across
the finish line now. - [Chandler] You're all kind of screwed if you don't run faster. - Yep, you're right. - Green light. Red light. - Only two minutes remain. - Karl makes me way too nervous. - Green light. Red light. - We have under one minute remaining. Time's ticking, green light. Red light. You have stepped on
the line, you are good. You're good. You're good. - Lets go! - Red light. (gun shot) It worked, it worked, we got em. You're definitely out. Dude, I knew that would work, green light. Red light. You're definitely, so
many of you just got out. - They gotta run faster. - They've gotta, you gotta sprint. - Green light. Green light. I'm not even gonna say red light, I'm not saying red light. Ah, its too late. Too late. (crowd cheering) - Whoa. - Holy crap. - Congratulations on surviving
red light green light. (contestants cheering) So if you look at this TV, you'll see that only (TV twinkling) 232 of you survived. If you look above your head, you'll see the $456,000
you're competing for. And now let's move on to honeycomb. In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle, and a cookie with a different shape on it, and they have 10 minutes to remove the shape from the cookie. But if they break the
shape, they're eliminated. All right, so everybody
I'm gonna need you to get in the line in front of one of these question marks. (tense music) Why did you pick this one? - Just like, the middle. - Basically you don't think it's umbrella. - There's an umbrella? - Did you even watch Squid Game? - So many of these people
are about to get out. - Reveal shape number one. (contestants cheering) - Reveal the second symbol. (contestants cheering) Look at how hype they're getting. If I was you, I'd be
getting pretty nervous. Reveal it! (contestants cheering) Chris, go for it. - No! - I know umbrella going home. That's all I got to say. - We got the circle. Thank God
we didn't get the umbrella. (tense music) - You look pretty nervous over here. Even though you got the star, you're the main character. so you have plot armor, you're fine. Start the timer. The challenge is underway. You just hear them all scraping. - I hate my life. - I was taking it out of the tin, and it just snapped in half. - Lets see it. - It's working. (clock ticking) - Take your time. - You had an umbrella? - Yeah.
- Sorry bud. - Look at this. We have
a successful triangle. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Oh no. - What Jimmy doesn't know
is I brought a lighter, and I'm gonna drop it for somebody. - What, what, what? - One and a half minutes remaining. (Yoshi licking sounds) - Let's get it, baby. Yeah, yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is the first
perfect umbrella I've seen. - Oh yeah, easy peasy. - Whoo! - Six, seven, okay, she passed. She does have plot armor. - [Woman] Almost there. - So close, 30 seconds. - Oh my God. - Are you serious? - Three, two, one. Time is up. - You did it? You did the umbrella? - And just like that, all these players have been eliminated. But don't worry because
they're all walking away with $2,000 in cash. 142 of you survived honeycomb. (crowd cheering) And if you leave in the next five minutes, I'll give you $4,000. Let's weed out some of the weak people. $4,000. - Thank you. - I was not expecting this many people. There we go, head on out. And with that, I'm gonna need you all to
split up into groups of 10. We had them form teams
because next up is tug of war. - This could determine your chance at half a million dollars. - We needed the strongest
people and the smartest people. We have intelligence, skill, and brawn. - We trying to recruit the biggest people, so we can get real
strong and pull the rope. - Sorry, no girls allowed. - Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay. - I just sent three people off. We got 10 now let's go. - Let's go! - I should have taken the four grand. - We now have 12 different
groups of 10 people. Let's move on to the next game. And now let's decide who faces who? (contestants cheering) Okay, we're gonna draw one from here. Six, we'll just draw this one. Five, okay. Follow me to the bridge. And now the moment
you've been waiting for. A game of tug of war. Team six versus team five. - Team five on three. One two, three, team five. - You've fall in the
foam, or your flag crosses to the other team's
side. You're eliminated. Are you guys ready? - [All] Yeah! - Are you ready? - [All] Yeah! - All right, three, skip a few, go. - Pull! - Power! - Oh, it's going to team five right now. Team six is falling. Somebody's right at the edge. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. (crowd cheering) - Congratulations, team five, you have all moved on. Team number two versus team number seven. (team cheering) They seem happy. Team seven and two head on out. - You keep me alive,
we're gonna get the money. (team cheering) - Give it up, this team's winning. - Go, oh, it's already on right side. Hey, let's check in on 067. In the show you won, so let's see if it works here. And Karl, we have 067. You should just lose. - Karl no, give them motivation. - Pull! - Its over here, it crossed. (team cheering) Sir, can you come over here? Why don't you draw? Don't look, grab one from
here, and one from here, and then grab one from here. Team number four versus team number 10. (team cheering) If I was you guys, I'd be terrified, 'cause they have 456. He's literally the main character. - Let's go! - Three, two, one, go. Oh, they're getting, oh. Oh, it's going over to 456. They're falling. They're dropping They all just fell. Obviously we have no way of rigging it, but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war. Let's draw, oh boy. Nine versus 11. (crowd cheering) In this game with team
nine versus team eleven, they went so hard that this happened. They are going all out, look at them. Oh they're falling. Don't let them. Oh yes. Oh, they broke the set. They literally broke it. You guys can move on. Go ahead and head on now. Tug of war took us from
120 people down to 60. And remember, only one of
these people is walking away with $456,000. All right, everybody. Can we have your attention? As you guys know from Squid Games, game number four is marbles. (contestants cheering) - I don't know if I'd be cheering, because instead of letting
you pick your partner, we're gonna make you partner
with your best friend. Throughout this entire challenge, we've been monitoring who
you've been talking to the most, and we're gonna make you
partner up with them. And only one of you can move on. For example, 067 and 431. - That's my best friend. - According to this, you two
are roommates and best friends. We did our research. - I have to come home
to the house we live in at the end of the day, gonna be a bit awkward. - Wouldn't be able to
do it without you, man. - We couldn't have done
it without each other. - I'm glad I'm with you at the end. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody
gets a bag of 10 marbles, and they have to agree
on a game to play it against their best friend. 20 marbles lets them move on. But by winning, they
eliminate their best friend. Go ahead and start the timer. You can play whatever game you want, but you need 20 to leave. A lot of pairs went with marble games that were played in Squid Game. - Odd. - Even. - Odd or even? - Even on that side. - What? What game are you playing? - We don't know. One marble at a time,
it's gonna take all day. - If you keep talking, it might. - Okay. - [Mr. Beast] And other
groups got creative. - What is this game? - We're throwing it at the bricks, right? If you get the middle one
right there, that's one point. But if you hit the bricks in the behind, then its three points. Everything else is no points
until the clock runs down, Whoever has most points is the winner. - All right, well good
luck with your game. - But one group just
wanted to get it over with. You're doing even odds for all of it. Yo, he looks so intense. - He's got one marble. - Are you sure? - Oh, he got it, oh my gosh. Congratulations on winning. I'll see you in the next round. - You're good buddy, you're good, okay? - I'm so sad. - Why are you sad? It's gonna be okay. - We promised each other we were not gonna screw each other over. I didn't even know we
were gonna be this close. - I'm doing this for my
family, but I'm nervous. - Best man's gonna win. - Best man win man. - Best man's gonna win. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody,
you've got five minutes left. - Don't look at me. - They want to put
$465,000 Up to a coin flip. - You had to make it sound like that, huh? Tails. - It's tails. - Yo, oh no. - Odd? - I'll give you the honor of
eliminating your best friend. - Oh no, that's even worse. - Ah. - Aww. - It doesn't hurt. Before I eliminate you, I wanna let the viewers
know that someone random that subscribes in the next
seven days is getting $10,000. So if you haven't already,
hit the subscribe button okay? - Can I do it? - Go for it. Just hit right there. - Oh. - Don't fall, they're so dramatic. So if you haven't already subscribe and you could win 10 grand. What game are we playing? - Closest to the wall. - A minute and 15 seconds remain. When that hits zero, if you're in here, you're eliminated. - I have one more question to ask. - What's up, man? - You promise to remember me? - Oh my gosh. - What do you mean? - You're literally both
about to get eliminated. Oh, what was that? - Why'd you do that? - You sure?
- Yeah. - He has been eliminated, thank you, sir. - I love you, man. - The time has hit zero. Everyone in here is eliminated. Congratulations on surviving marbles. At this point in the real show, there was an all out
brawl to thin the numbers. So instead we're gonna play Ddakji. You have to use this blue piece of paper to flip that red one on
the ground by throwing it. The first 16 of you to
flip your red square moves on to glass bridge, which is personally my favorite game. Everyone throw. Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone. And while they're
fighting for their chance in this competition, I wanna tell you guys about Brawl Stars, who helped fund this video, which cost over three and
a half million dollars. Thank you so much. Throw. - Yes! - Brawl Stars is a mobile
game you can play at home, on the go, in this
arena, wherever you want against millions of
people across the world. Oh, we got some. Congratulations. It's three minutes of
adrenaline filled mayhem, and they have 12 different game modes, including their own battle Royale, which is kind of similar
to what we're doing here. - Yes!
- Yes! - Yeah, let's go. - We have nine winners so far, which means only seven places remain. You said you played Brawl Stars? - We both do. - Oh, you both play Brawl Stars? What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars? - That it's pretty fun. It's a mobile game, you can
download it on Android or Apple. - I didn't tell him to say this. - Lets go! - Yeah! - Yo, the main characters survived. As you can see, you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it. They have over 50 different
characters you can play as, from a vintage driven robot
to a cactus named spike, that kind of looks like Nolan. - Hey. - And like all our
contestants here are leaving with $2,000 for free today. Every single person that plays Brawl Stars within the next seven days, I will personally be
giving you a free prize. So if you haven't already, go download it. If you yell ""Thank you, Brawl Stars."" Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it. - [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars! - Oh, it worked for him. - Oh my God, it's true. - Thank you, Brawl Stars. - And for the 14 of you
that didn't flip it, I'm gonna have to eliminate you. Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh. Now can all of you winners turn around. Thank you, and now you
can turn around again. We just filled the room with
16 different mannequins, and here's the thing. They're actually in a random order. And the numbers on them are in Korean. And the number they get here is what order they have
to cross in glass bridge. In a timely and orderly
fashion. You can all go. First come, first serve. What'd you get? Oh, she got one. Oh. - 15, okay. - All right, if you wanna
just go ahead and leave now. Everyone has a vest with numbers,
let's go to glass bridge. We are now at the glass bridge set, and look at how insane this thing looks. It is amazing. And bring out the contestants. I can't wait to see the
look on their faces. - [Contestant] Oh, what? Oh my God. - Players, welcome to glass bridge. (contestants cheering) There is two platforms you can jump on. One will drop you, and one will hold you. Start the timer. Begin the challenge. - Okay. - Let's go, girl. - I'm sticking with the
guys I'm sticking with. I'm sticking, I'm sticking. - All right, she survived the first jump. Okay, they are one for one so far. - Go right? - I'm always right. - Okay. - I don't know if I'd listen to Chris. - Chris, this is on you. - Hey, victory. - We had our first loss. If you're wondering where
she just fell, don't worry, there's a giant foam pit
down there, she's fine. Well now, now you know. Now you know left. - Come on, 13 Minutes guys. - We now have three
people on the platform. Only one out so far. - I'm not moving. I want somebody past eight
to take the next step. - Past eight? All right, I love that, yo. - Hey. Three minutes has gone by. - Is anybody willing to go? Clock's ticking. - [Mr. Beast] All right, let's see it. (tense music) - Come on, man. You got this.
- Come on, Ted. - Yes. - Now go two. Now you go. - Come on two, you got this. - I'll take the next one. - All right, bro. - Come on four, five, let's go. - Let's go. - Lets go, two. Let's go, two. Oh, you already knew that one. - Oh, oh. - Oh. - You see how many I've gotten? Take the next one. - How many did you guess right? - Three.
- Three? - Yeah.
- Wow. Yeah, honestly it's time
someone else steps up. - Hey every second
somebody doesn't step up, that's less time you got. - Hey, if no one crosses,
I just keep the money. - All right, three went for it. - Three just got eliminated. All right, two, he took the L for you. - Adio time two. - Hey honestly, hey two,
if you're three for three, you might as well keep going. Clearly, you're lucky. - Oh my God, all right. - [Mr. Beast] No pushing,
obviously, please. - Come on. - Two bit the bullet. - Two's gone. - Under eight minutes. You've still got a ton of ground to cover. - Yeah, he's good. - I don't understand why number 10 went in front of everyone. That was dumb. - Come on buddy. - Yo did 10 make it again? - All right, it looks like
number four is gonna go. - Six minutes remaining. - I'm doing this for the girls. - Let's salute all the fallen people. All right, continue. Under five minutes left. Tons of jumps. This is gonna get intense. - Oh, that was crazy. - No ten's gone, no. - [Mr. Beast] Another one gone. - All right, don't move bud, don't move. - I'm not moving. - Your odds don't look
back there right now. - Nah, I'm not moving. I'm not moving. - All right, just like
we thought would happen, They're refusing to move. Let's see who budges. - I'm pretty good where I am. - Lets go. - You got it. - Oh, he got it. - All right, no, not a chance, come on. - When are y'all big
numbers taking a chance? - Under three minutes
with four jumps left. - Somebody's gonna have to do it. Y'all are in a real bad spot. I'm not moving. - What are y'all big numbers
taking a leap of faith? - Hey, how are you doing back there, 15? - Whatever, man, we could all lose. - You guys better hurry up. - They have two minutes,
why are they not rushing? - If you go, I'll take the next one. - All right.
- Come on. - You jumping? - Y'all really got me scared, but hold up bro. This is a real life decision. - 90 seconds, one and a half minutes. - Come on now, come on, come on, come on. - Six. - Jump, jump, jump. Oh, you passed. - I ain't moving, I am not moving. Y'all, there's a God
telling me I'm not moving. - One minute remaining. Three jumps, one minute. Hey, you guys in the back, if you're not here when
it hits zero, you're gone. - I took my leap of faith, now I'm gonna stay right here and be cozy. - Hurry, go. - Y'all go. - [Mr. Beast] It's just three. (All clamoring) - Take a leap of faith, come on, come on. - You're up. - I can't jump, they're in my way. They're in my way. - They're all crowded on that one. - Hey, 30 seconds. - Go, go. - Go, take a leap of faith. Go, go, go. - One more jump. 20 seconds. One more jump. - I already jumped, I'm not jumping I'm not jumping. - 10, nine, eight, seven, six. - Someone go. - Let me go watch the replay real quick. I'm gonna play the footage
and slowmo for the viewers. As you can see, the timer is on zero and
there were four people still clearly on the platforms
when the timer hit zero. The four people were
16, eight, 13, and five. All right, so the four
losers, can you jump off? Just jump, you're eliminated,
you're eliminated. You're eliminated, get outta here. Thank you for coming out. And all of you are moving
onto the final game. They're competing for $456,000, let's go. Congratulations on
making it to the top six. To celebrate, we made
you all steak dinners. Now, unlike the show,
this isn't a real knife, this is plastic. But, you do have steak. Everyone make sure you eat up, so you have plenty of
energy for this final game. - I'm thinking about winning
all of that money right now. I'm probably give most of
it to my family, friends. - That money's coming home with me, giving $100K straight to my mama. - I'm feeling great, it's
just blessed to be here. - I'm gonna pull through, I'm definitely donating
about 10,000 to TEAMSEAS, which all of you should
if you have the means. - I won't fold under no pressure. I'm not worried about none of these five. Ain't nobody got nothing
on me, so I'm good. - You wanna just go settle
this with the final game? - Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it. - Let's do it. - Welcome to the final
game of Beast Games. So I think you guys can piece together what we're about to play. - Musical chairs. - Musical chairs, yeah. Let's test my hypothesis, raise your hand if you know
how to play Squid Game. Exactly, that's why we're
doing musical chairs instead, because we're not Korean, start circling. Start the music. Karl, you can stop it whenever you want. Karl do not look. Chris, don't look. Karl isn't looking so we can't be biased. All right, let's see what happens. Oh, oh he got it. - I got more, man. I'm pretty sure.
- He's way more. I'm sorry about that. Oh no. - Sorry bro. - Bring the coffin over here. Hop on in the coffin. He has officially been
eliminated, and five remain. This chair is now gone. Karl, start the music. (ominous music)
Okay. You have full... Oh, hold on, hold on. No more moving, come over here. No why'd you get up? - Nah, he had it. He had it. - At least he is honest. Oh my gosh. And while they're coffining
him up, play the music. (ominous music)
Okay. The music has begin. $456,000 on the line. - It's about to happen at any second. - Oh man, oh, you sat. Oh no. - He sat early, he sat early. - Karl did not stop the music. Bring out the coffin, I'm
gonna have to pop you. Man, that's such a sad way to go out. - It was a great journey, I loved it. It was so fun. - Hop on in the coffin. All right. Now you can't
say this is scripted. Good luck. (ominous music)
Okay. The music has started. Three people, two chairs. One must go. Keep it moving now. You gotta keep moving. Gotta keep moving. Oh no. - Yes! - They were against me. They were against me bruh.
- Oh my God. - They plotted on me. - You have been eliminated. Open up the coffin. Thank you for coming out, man. - No problem.
- I loved your energy. at the start of this
video, we had 456 people. Now we're down to these two. - Yeah!
- Yeah! - Okay, I'm gonna take
this chair right here. You guys gotta keep
moving the entire time. No stopping and hovering. This will determine which
one of you wins 456 grand, Karl, kick the music on. (ominous music)
Hey, let it play a little bit, Karl. Lets let them soak in it. Karl's not looking at them. He has no idea where
they are on the chair. - Somebody's gonna get $456,000
because you pause the music. - Oh boy. Oh, this is, oh the intensity. When will he pause it? When's he gonna pause it? - Yo, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, my God! - If it makes you feel better, I'm gonna give you $10,000
for coming in second place. - Oh, you're kidding me.
- No. And with that 079, you just want $456,000, and officially won the very first Squid Game in real life ever. Congratulations on winning. If you haven't already,

half $1 million experience looks like. I promise this is going
to blow your mind. In this video, you will find out
why it cost a quarter of $1 million to simulate going to space. Why it costs $50,000 to explore
the depths of our oceans. Whoa! It's coming right at us! And every other experience
we tried along the way. I'm standing on top of the
tallest building in the world! Oh my God! All the way down to the
cheapest experience I could find. Riding a camel. How long can I ride
this camel for a dollar? One dollar, two minute. Deal. That's a
great $1 experience. Hold on tight. Wait.
Hold on tight, why? Oh my God. I wanted to ride camels in Egypt,
but they're way more than a dollar. So I'm gonna throw
the pyramids up in post Yo! Yeah. It's beautiful. Dude, this is a workout
to stay on this thing. I mean, I'm so
high up in the sky. Now you know what it's
like to be me and Chandler. Okay. Well, $1 only got us two
minutes and that time is up. Let's go have dinner in the sky. For $10,000, you can
go 3000 feet in the sky with a chef who uses this
hot air balloon as her kitchen. You can see the shadow from
the balloon over there in the field. Dude! This is a little higher than I
expected, I'm not gonna lie. But this isn't your everyday
dinner at 3000 feet in the air. This Michelin star chef uses the
flame from the hot air balloon itself to literally cook the food
for the meal she's preparing. MrBeast. Oh. Yo! That's our next
course of food, bro. Now, we're about to
have fish that they cooked with the fire from the
hot air balloon. Oh, thank you. Oh my gosh. Jimmy, this is amazing. Look how beautiful it is down there.
Such an amazing view while we eat. This fish never dreamed
of being this high up. If you got an extra ten grand and want
to impress a girl, I would recommend this. Every single one of these ten
gourmet courses was phenomenal. But I still had one
question I needed to ask. As a Michelin star chef, what do
you think of this Feastables bar? Very good on balance. And
what I like is the crunch in the chocolate. Feastables is now Michelin star approved.
The 10K experience was very beautiful. Amazing. Up next is the 50K
experience and Chandler and Karl have no idea what
I have in store for them. What do you think of the yacht? I think it's beautiful.
It's pretty. Yeah. Do you think it costs
50 grand for the day? No. Okay. So look over there. We're gonna go on a
submarine expedition. Oh my God. You guys ready to explore
the floor of the ocean? Yeah! Okay, let's do this. - What?
- We're not doing that. Let's head over. Okay. Come on. Yeah! Let's go explore the
floor of the ocean. - Okay.
- All right. This is awesome. Whoa!
I can already see fish. Look! We haven't
even gone down yet. Look it’s a barracuda! You guys want to scrape the
floor of the ocean? We can. We can do anything. We have this entire submarine to
ourselves and can explore whatever we want. Let's do everything. Except crashing.
We are not allowed to do that. Okay. And to make sure we got the
very best angles down here. We paid scuba divers
to follow the submarine. Isn't this cool? Let's communicate
with them ""Shark behind"" everyone freak out.
Okay? Start freaking out. Got'em! While we're underwater,
Tareq and Nolan are also on a $50,000
safari in Africa. And we're gonna see if we see
more cool creatures down here than they do over there. Spoiler.
We will. This is gorgeous. All right, let's go find
the king of the jungle. We cannot leave Africa until we
see a lion. Do you understand? I do understand. Why did
you point at me like that? Look, look, look. Oh, warthog! Yo, it’s Pumba! You scared him. You scared him. I'm sorry, I shouldn't yell.
I was not supposed to yell. Zebras! I feel like zebras
would taste good. Like if I was a lion, I'd always go
for a zebra. They just look thick. What? Bro, this is so worth $50,000. Yeah. This is so
worth Jimmy’s $50,000. Wait, Karl, what if instead of
being a ship that's a submarine? We're taking this
thing back up again. Wow, look at how close
we are to those rocks. Is it okay? How close we are? - Yeah, it's okay.
- All right. But we weren't the only ones
getting up close and personal. Zebras! Where are you going? Hey, buddy.
Wait! Don't go. Come back! Tareq, let's talk about
the elephant in the room. There's two right behind you. They are unnervingly close. They're very close. Oh, it's awfully close.
It is coming towards us. We just got charged
by an elephant. Oh, it's there! -It's the coolest thing ever!
-Look at him! That thing is a unit. That’s my dad. This is way cooler
than a submarine. I’d rather see this than a fish. Also, my heart’s beating
out of my chest right now. And that was the 50k experience. What
we have coming up next is even better. This thing pales
in comparison to the $250,000 zero
gravity experience. This company will fly
you up and then nosedive, creating a zero gravity
environment inside the plane. The $250,000
experience starts now. Oh my water! Wow. Oh my God! I'm upside down! Oh my God. Oh, I
can’t stop floating! Go long! Oh, that was awesome. Oh my gosh, this is sick! On this next drop, we're
gonna race to the other side. Turn on zero gravity. -Oh, yeah.
-Dude! I’m winning! I can’t go anywhere! Nolan's losing. We made it! -We made it.
-We won! Guys! Turns out racing without
gravity doesn't work so well. But luckily, Karl
had a better idea. I'm gonna test
out a leaf blower. All right, wait for it. He’s spinning! Oh God! -He’s actually spinning!
-Stop! Oh my God. And before we turn
the gravity off again. We’re gonna try to make some of our
MrBeast Lab Swarms in zero gravity. - You ready?
- Yeah. Nolan, let's
try to make some! I created the coolest toys ever. All you have to do is
pour water into the tube, shake it and you'll find
out which Swarms you got. I’m gonna squirt some water. Give me some! We’re getting swarmed
by these toys right now. This isn’t as easy as I thought. Anyways,
there's over 119 Swarms to collect. You can find Swarms in packs
of five, packs of two and singles available at Walmart, Target,
and Amazon in the United States and everywhere around the
world at your top toy retailers. It’s my favorite toy! -I’m weightless.
-Go get it at your local Walmart. These are the most
exciting toys this holiday season and they're
flying off the shelves. Karl, catch! Make sure you buy MrBeast Labs 
before they're sold out. That's going to be cool. Hold on, Nolan, catch. Yeah. Body slam! I have no idea how the $500,000
experience is going to top this. But let's go find out. And after going all around
the entire world to film this video... We’re at
the $500,000 experience. This is the craziest view ever. Unlike any spectacle seen
before in the history of mankind, my friends and I are about to
see what half a million dollars can allow you to experience in the most
luxurious metropolis in the entire world. The city of Dubai, a place carved
from the desert but created for pleasure. And at the end of
this video, I'm going to become one of the few
individuals in history to stand on top of the
tallest building in the world. We went all out. It is
going to blow your mind. Let's go have some fun. How are we here? So after we found our way
off this 500ft picture frame, we made our way over
to this castle of a hotel. Wow. This is insane. Water in our backyard. The first two floors of this
hotel room are magnificent. But the coolest one, by far, is the
third level that's completely underwater. Oh my God! Welcome to Atlantis. We love
you all. Except for you, Karl. Sorry, man. He went into a thing with
sharks just to make fun of me. For the record, there is
over 80 sharks in this tank. And later in this experience, we're
actually going to be swimming with them. And for the cherry on
top to wrap all this up. Come on. We're going to go skydiving. No way. Yes! Dude, falling from thousands
and thousands of feet in the air. Don't worry about that.
Let's go race F1 karts. Yeah. What better place to do so
than at the Dubai Autodrome? Home to some of the
fastest cars in the entire city. Just grab whatever car
you want. Let's go race. - All right.
- Let's go. And I called up some of
the biggest local creators to have a field
day with these supercars. Let's have some fun. They're going so fast. And this is just the first of many
experiences we're going to be doing here. We are just getting started. I'm ready to race! We’re about to lap someone.
We're catching up to them. Oh no, Jimmy! No, no. Come on, grandma. I don't think my mom
will be happy watching me race. I don't think she could
drive slower if she wanted to. That's illegal. Okay.
That's like. That's really illegal. While my friends and I were
pretending to be race car drivers. Woo! Karl was getting ready to drive
an actual Formula level race car. I look so cool now.
Let's do this thing. Off to a rocky start. Oh my God, I'm driving a formula car!
This is the best day of my life! For the price of this
experience, we actually got to keep
this brand new Lamborghini. I want to enjoy it a little bit. In case you were curious,
this bad boy is fast. Let's go to an NBA game,
all the way in Abu Dhabi. But to be honest, guys, I'm
not the kind of guy who likes to drive around sports cars and
plus, we cannot find a parking spot. So, I'm just going to find
someone to give this thing to. Do any of you watch
the MrBeast channel? Yup! That says subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lamborghini? I’d prefer someone
else to have it. What? What the
heck just happened? Hey, sir.
Security, can you come over here? Oh, he’s subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lambo? Yeah, please. All right, get in. This is
officially your Lamborghini. I am actually shaking right now. This is why you gotta
make sure you're subscribed. I'd hate for you to
lose a Lamborghini. Hey, boys. What are you doing?
We got courtside tickets. Enjoy! I am so happy. With the Lamborghini
now off my hands, I gotta sit courtside at a pro
basketball game. But instead, it just ended
up turning into a photoshoot. Nice to meet you! Then afterwards, I
said hi to Steve Harvey. Nice to finally meet you! How you feeling? I’m doing good!
And after that, Russell Westbrook. -Y’all good?
-Good. And with $200,000 worth
of experiences left to do. Up next, we got to take
over a massive water park. Somehow in the middle of the
desert, hang out with penguins. I heard you're the alpha.
That is an alpha thing to do. And since that wasn't enough, I am now in
a giant pool with 80 sharks and stingrays. Hello there, sir. Hey! Hey! Come back here!
I was trying to talk to you. He's like Buzz Lightyear. Whoa! Oh, excuse me, sir.
Yo, we got some... I am Aquaman, the
king of the sharks. My first decree is the
sharks bite him and not me. Agreed? Oh, attack Karl! That is a dinosaur! I am your leader. Attack him. No! That should not exist. I think they just
unplugged my oxygen. Well, before this guy turns
me into fish food, let's go get our own dinner at a restaurant
straight out of the future. Hello, everybody. Jimmy, you’re sitting there. What is this, Jimmy? I don't know. I don't
think I've ever sat at a restaurant this far
away from my friends. Gentlemen, prepare yourself
for a once in a lifetime experience. We will start with our first
appetizer. Take it in one bite! Cheers. Cheers. What if I don't like it? Is it good? This is amazing. That whole plate
was just that one bite? Yeah. Okay. Whoa.
What is going on? What? It's like a
Call of Duty mission. Am I getting hacked? I thought this was a
restaurant, not a movie theater. I don't know what's going on. This nine course meal
is surrounded by full 360 interactive visuals that
change based on the dish. Whoa! Wait, does it, oh,
it responds to your touch. Boy’s we're now defending Earth. I'm impressively bad at this. But even though the
room was impressive. Dude, they're getting tripped up
on my water right now. Look at that. It was the one of a kind food and drinks
that made this experience truly unique. You can touch
the glass it’ll react with you. We got to try nine mouthwatering
courses from freshly caught seafood. Whoa! Oh my God. To golden wagyu burger. You approve? Oh, yeah. Hey, we found
one Chandler likes. They even had one final
course specialized just for us. Who is that? Thats Chandler. That is not... Bro, that is not me. But anyways, let's keep
the experience going. All we have left before
I literally fall out of the sky and climb the
tallest building on earth is to test my fear of heights
at a pool suspended in the sky. Look at this view. Jimmy! Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Whatever you're seeing right
now does not do this justice. No way. Standing over 600ft in the sky, this
360 degree infinity pool gives you a breathtaking view
of every square inch of the city. Let's hop on in boys. Yeah, I'm getting in. That island behind me is man made.
Everything about this is mind blowing. Now we're going to stick
this bad boy over the ledge. Jesus, man. Check out the view. Is that not amazing? We're on top of Dubai. All right, guys. It's time
we fall from the sky. Dude, you're
just falling to the Earth. No, you're falling to
this manmade island. Oh my God,
I'm so scared. Buckle up because what
you're about to witness, I never thought I’d
do in my entire life. Literal maniacs.
Who does this willingly? But what would a video
about experiences be without attempting to face
one of my biggest fears. Falling out of the sky. If I don't make this
still upload the video! This is getting real. No! I have a family! Prepare for takeoff. It’s getting real!
We're going up! I know. I can't believe we're
actually doing this. This is nuts. What are the odds I die? I don't know. Oh my God! Approaching
ten thousand feet. We are so high. I'm not ready. Jimmy! I'm not ready. Go! Come on! You're going first. Jimmy, I hate you!
I changed my mind! Oh, my God. Yeah!
We're spinning! Oh, God. I'm scared! Bye Jimmy! I don't wanna do this! Oh my God!
This is terrifying! I'm not going! How was it? I'm scared. You're scared. Yeah. We're still
pretty high up. This is probably
my biggest fear ever. Oh, gosh.
But I did this for you guys. Okay. I'm not dead.
I'm alive. Where’s Chandler?
Did Chandler not jump? Where's Chandler? Chandler either didn’t jump
or splatted on the ground. Oh, God, I hope
he didn’t jump. Sorry Jimmy, I’m not doing it! Well it’s a good thing I didn't
ask Chandler to join me on the biggest experience
of this whole video, because... Behind me is the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on
Earth. And to wrap up this experience, I'm
going to go stand all the way on top of it. The first step of reaching
the peak of this 2700ft building is taking a series of
elevators over 160 stories into the sky. But as for the
remaining 900ft, I had no choice but to climb to the top myself.
This thing is tall. That is a lot of ladders. I underestimated how
hard it is to get up to the top. But even after a full hour of climbing, there was still a lot of
skyscraper left to go. I thought I finally made it to the top,
but there's still a lot left. This thing never ends.
Step by step, I started to question whether I really
wanted to keep going. I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Surely we’re almost there. Take that as a no. But
despite all this endurance, I reminded myself that this was my
moment to be one of the few individuals ever to experience standing on
top of the tallest building on Earth. I knew there was no turning back. Alright. Homestretch!
Woo! Alright. I made it! I'm standing on top
of the tallest building in the world! This is insane! Holy crap. I'm high up. Oh, this is terrifying. Oh, I shoudn’t have looked
down that’s scary. I might puke. I’ll admit, Feastables tastes better on the
ground, because on the ground I'm not on the verge of passing out.
I'm so afraid of heights. I find time and time again
that when I face my fears, I usually end up enjoying it
and learning a lot about myself. I'm very grateful for this
experience, and I would encourage you guys to go
outside your comfort zone. Do something you
wouldn't normally do. I think you'll end up enjoying it
and learn a lot about yourself. Thanks for watching! I hope you enjoyed
all the effort we put in this video! I love you guys!"

that sounds easy so see those three blocks everybody yeah yeah jump on the first one oh i missed i made it i made the first one i watched pewdiepie play this a long time ago i've already lost three lives i've lost two hmm it would help if i jumped and there's spikes on the third block of course should i wait at this level for you to catch up ah crap [Music] oh oh oh almost got it oh no what ah i made it i hate you yes okay i made it i made it jump over the third one and land right now how do i get past this how did it hit me i wasn't even looking spikes come get you if you stay there too long hey but what the i'm waiting at the next level and i just died because of jimmy what do i do try not dying what if jimmy has to do it because he can't get past i got it i got it okay okay now you guys don't get the gist of the game this thing is incredibly hard now here's the thing if you can get to the 10th level you pass that's what the challenge but if you can't get to the 10th level you have to get slimed slimes wait no if you don't get to the 10th level you have to get slimed you boys have 30 minutes good luck jimmy i'm stuck i don't know where to go from here where are you at i'm on level

understand how do you get in the ball what's the furthest level you guys have gotten to i'm on level four level four oh oh what chris how do you get past the spike wall on four i think you have to do uh a very risky wait why are you helping him i don't know why did i tell him what are you talking about no nothing not talking about nothing i'm gonna flip how about what if i flip chris yes i'm at the end of round three and the wall just falls and hits me what do i do um get better maybe oh i did it no come on i don't even understand the next one how i'm not telling ignore my balls oh no that was so close ah oh my honk baby i don't understand i'm at the end of level three what do i do jimmy you gotta trigger the wall and then jump in the air off the edge and jump back on so you what go away notifications guys it's a cry pov are you crying it's about to be oh oh i figured it out what it fooled me it'll do that if you sit there too long i get it now what oh shoot was i supposed to be on that little crevice i was how oh my gosh this is impossible on an iphone especially on the boulder man why what is hitting me [Music] no they always come straight for me it's like they're targeting me and you guys believe that some people play this game for fun no chance anybody does that look the balls come for me for no reason so we buy me a new phone hey carl yes you hear chris raging yeah yeah don't you think he should just get good jimmy how's level three treating you i'm on level four thank you very much oh level six pog let's go i made it on five yeah i swear to god if the back button look at all this space why why would they put so much space there oh my i how do you get past level four i figured out how to beat level five and i'm starting to understand level six but i just got game over i'm not telling anybody how to do five everybody just be quiet i'm trying to concentrate what i can't dude ow carl how do you be five please oh i almost beat six cool now now i'm stuck at three again that's cool i thought you said it was easy it is except for the controls are bad i'm gonna break my phone wait what the heck what am i supposed to do you guys are gonna cry on six i finally figured out how to beat five you guys are gonna freak out on six i'm telling you right now i can't even express it what's the highest level you've been to chandler i'm on five currently chandler's highest is five chris is five carls is six minus four carl why are these orange things spawning on level five i don't i have no idea i think that means you're taking too long oh i beat it i

like i know what i need to do but the controls are so bad it doesn't make any sense the ball goes not in the geometrically correct way it just goes wherever the it wants it's guarding the exit it is and you swear to god the balls just guard the exit yes i did it oh my god oh i remember this i remember this from the pewdiepie video with the ending for six you just die like what am i supposed to do oh my god dude i'm so stressed out ah how do you go oh my gosh six is impossible oh i was so close i was so close to being six oh i know how to do six now how do you beat floor number five someone

get started as you can see there are five staircases behind us at the top of each one is a fabulous treasure ours for the taking wow what kind of treasure is at the top let's go all right we're going to climb each of the five stair cases and find out what they're hiding this one is first oh it's made of dirt I'm so excited let's go what's this it looks like a parkour section Mikey we're already pretty high up I wouldn't want to fall that would hurtt be careful nice pop across let's keep moving hang on H it's a dead end there's no way to get up there we can't reach you're right but look over here we walk right past this chest oh there might be something useful inside let's see huh well what do we have here there's a slime block a sticky piston and a lever but how are those going to help us check this out let's put it together like this see oh we can hop on top of here try it out sure ready go wo I made it sweet thanks yep I was launched pretty high okay I'll try not to fall off let's try it again here I go 3 2 1 yes nice I made it let's go all right okay wo what's all this it's not safe we're high up this is scary Mikey I don't want to fall off go slow so high I can barely look down this is seriously crazy take it easy and you won't fall all right it looks like we have more parkour ahead be careful stay focused this is tough that was close but I made it okay I made it yes wow we're almost to the top look wo already that was easier than I thought now we just have to get the treasure from inside this house still don't let your guard down okay let's go here we go H what no seriously uh Mikey huh you fell there was a hole inside I know it's a trap that you have to jump over to get inside man let's jump woo it's pretty easy a come on no way okay try again finally I made it wo nice all right that ho we made it to the chest so let's open it up and see what kind of Treasure's inside open wow oh nice amazing check it out it was full of coins awesome woohoo we got the treasure I'm really stoked about all these coins we made it to the top of the first staircase and we got our treasure woohoo all right let's move on next one now we're climbing the wooden staircase yep let's get to it hold on look over here there's a chest what's inside let's find out oh bows and arrows huh hey we both get a set that's nice but why do we need these to climb a staircase huh you make a good point oh there's a button here look you're right let's push it maybe it has treasure can I be careful Mikey it could be a trap it's fine three 2 1 push what is this stuff what I'm backing up what is it it looks like poison the staircase is covered in Poison ouch there's no way we can climb up now ouch it hurts this is seriously bad we need a plan do we give up maybe not see that button you pushed yeah if we can go push it again maybe the poison will stop flowing down the stairs but we can't reach the button now we can't even get close what do we do well Mikey there might still be a way we still have our bows what if yeah we push the button with an arrow oh I'll try it too that's a tough shot a again oh I hit it wow look the poison it's going away wo Nice Shot thanks can we climb it yeah once it all clears up we can start climbing again what a nasty trap but we figured out the solution the poison is gone let's go and please don't touch the button again I promise I won't come on let's go quick okay I wonder what's at the top huh h a dead end again oh man well we can't climb or jump that high but look there are two buttons this time one on the left and one on the right yeah so one has to be the correct choice and the other a trap which one is it um well let's try the one on the left yeah okay I have a good feeling this time it will give out treasure can I put push it sure but be careful okay please be something good here it goes ouch hun so oh no Mikey lava wo it's still spitting out lava Mikey the left button was the wrong choice no kidding the right button is good want to push it but what if it's another trap should I yeah I'll push it I hope it's safe come on treasure bam water wo Co wow we can climb the water hey you're right wo good work Mikey it's set up so we can climb using the water okay yeah a little more all right let's go yay let's move almost there we're at the top hm h Huh where's the entrance there's no way in look Mikey H there's another button oh if we push it will an entrance appear H but what if we push it and something bad happens it could be a trap I don't want to push it you do it okay Mikey I wonder what it will do 3 2 1 H it worked oh when you push this button a secret entrance opens up up you're right let's go in here we go what's inside go here I come it's a narrow path I wonder what's down there stay on guard let's explore there must be something h Huh a dead end really oh there's another button see you're right but it might be a trap be careful okay I'll push it here I go good luck click h ah is that a hidden chest this must be the treasure let's open it up wo cool look at this awesome wow swords armor let's try it out yeah here you take some too Mikey there's more than enough for both of us check out this armor WoW sweet looking sharp hey you too man this treasure was totally worth all that effort going up yep not too shabby looking good we climbed the wooden staircase ready to move on definitely all right next we're going to climb the white quart staircase I wonder what treasure awaits let's go yeah there's something here hurry what a chest let's open it hold up Mikey if you look closely it's actually a trap chest see that red around the latch we don't know what'll happen if we open it be careful it's fine there's probably something useful inside bam a it's bonus there's nothing good inside the chest what happened we're trapped no what we're I see the chest triggered a cage trap who cares we need to get out of this cage let's think about how we can escape from here was there anything inside the chest not really at least nothing that looked useful to me but really I'm going to take a look there's a stone sword yeah it's nothing good bricks crafting table watermelon and cobwebs I guess we could snack on the watermelon that'll help us survive wait a sec don't eat it I know what to do huh all of the items in the chest will help us Escape I have a plan how don't eat anything fine all right first yeah I'll put the crafting table here but it's not high enough the next step is Mikey huh so there are nine slices of watermelon right if we use the table then we can make a watermelon block oh I see there but I still can't reach Next Step H we have bricks we can use three to make a flower pot a pot I'll put it right here see already a bit higher it's not enough well not yet we haven't used the cobwebs yet we have eight of them ew first I'll put them all down like this okay then we use the stone sword what it's okay I promise just watch and see we have string and then what we put four strings together oh and we have wool then put it together huh it makes three pieces of carpet um yep now what watch this stand on the flower pot and then layer up the carpet and climb out of the cage oh wow your turn here I come here thanks okay you got this woohoo oh wow let's go let's keep moving nice another a chest open it there might be goodies oh a that's rotten flesh maybe we should take it with us just in case we need it I'll take the rest oh maybe this one has something good let's find out no huh more rotten flesh why H this is weird what's this H oh what wait a sec let's figure this out H it looks like we can't get through here the iron door is locked how do we get in what's the deal with this villager if we had a lever we could open this door so maybe the Villager has a [Music] lever I have an idea we trade our rotten flesh with the Villager and he gives us a lever that must be why he's here good idea yep okay H nope he won't trade for rotten flesh he wants a cake for his lever or a golden carrot for a laser rifle he drives a hard barget but we don't have either of those things what do we do now [Music] maybe we missed something let's retrace our steps we didn't miss anything we got it all we must have I like another chest yeah let's look H I don't see anything h no well y Mikey I found something really where it's under the stairs I'll check it out 3 2 1 wao perfect what is it it's full of ingredients I think we can use them to make cake and golden carrots ready let's start with the cake put an egg in the middle sugar on both sides and voila looks delicious yummy now the golden carrots first take the gold ingots o and make gold nuggets place the carrot in the middle and you have golden carrots here's yours Mikey thank you oh now we can finally trade with a villager a cake for a lever a golden carrot for a laser rifle and we did it we have everything we need I have a laser rifle too but I don't see how this is going

MoneyLion Beast Games Giveaway. No Purch Nec. 50 US + DC. 18+. Ends 11/27/25. T&Cs can be found at http://mlion.info/BGGRules.",MrBeast,,Entertainment,,2024-12-19T17:00:00Z,0:24:45,38174934,24105,,True,"I am sitting on 5 million dollars in cash
and competing for it. Open the gates! Are these two thousand contestants! What you are witnessing is just the start
of something never before seen in history. 2000 people are about to battle
in a series of trials for a spot in my ten episode
Prime Video series called Beast Games. Ladies and gentlemen, look to your left
and look to your right. 1000 of you will be eliminated
by the end of this video. But for the other half
of you moving on to Beast Games, one of you will walk
away with a life-changing, record-shattering grand prize
of 5 million dollars. And our first game is...
Drop the curtains! The first challenge of these trials
is gonna test your strength. - 10 thousand?!
- What?! My arms hurt looking at that. I need all of you to split up
into five groups of 400. Whichever group is the last
to lift that 10,000 pound boulder across that finish line is eliminated. Let's go! Group up! Group up! We got a strategy going.
The strong ones are at the front. This team was made to break backs,
break dreams and crush spirits. I'm going to be so for real,
I don't think I'm cut out for this. 400 of you are about to be eliminated. Home is not an option. Guys, this is for $5 million!
We don't want to be the first out. Three! Two! One! Go! Pull! You got it! Go! We got it. Pull! Holy crap, Jonathan, pull! Run. Run! Run! Run to the front! Pull! Let's go! Last boulder to touch
the top is eliminated. Let's go! Run! Run! Oh! Oh my gosh, that was insanely quick. Let's go green! Three teams reached the finish line. It's down to yellow and red.
Which one of you is going home? - Come on, red!
- Come on, we're losing! One, two, pull! No! We're doing it wrong!
We’re doing it so– Keep going! Run! We have to go backwards. No! That's yellow.
Oh, no. Red just lost out on this chance
to win 5 million dollars. Oh, man. That was my one thing
I told myself I did not want to be
eliminated first round. Red team, I'm sorry you got eliminated, but to make it feel
a little better... We're going to give you
$2,000 for competing. And that goes for all of you. Every single one of you will
receive $2,000 just for showing up. That's right.
It's three minutes into the video, and we've already given away $800,000. And with a total
of 2000 contestants competing, that means we're giving away $4 million
throughout Beast Games just for contestants showing up. So as these trials were heating up
and some people chose to go home early– It really is my time to step out. 24 hours I did it.
I did a day. At least they got to
walk away with $2,000, which might be a big brain move, because these trials are only going
to get more intense. Congratulations on passing
the first challenge. Don't you just love your teams? Yellow team,
don't you love each other? Green! Orange! Pink! Unfortunately for challenge two,
your teammates will be your opponents. Bring out the briefcases. Only pink team, stand around
the red border. Come on over. In front of you is a sea of briefcases. Some say eliminated.
Some say saved.  On the jumbotron,
we are going to quickly show which briefcases are safe
and which are eliminated. Your goal is to memorize where
the safe briefcases are and claim one before someone else does. Think fast and run faster because of the 400 people
on each team 50 of you will be ending up
with an eliminated briefcase. Alright, reveal the map. Okay. The second row. Seven. That's row number seven. I hope all of you have
a briefcase in mind. Three! Two! One! Go! Oh it’s like a sea of people.
Oh, okay. Oh my God. Hopefully, this is what I think it is. And if it's not, then I'm gonna find
someone to blame. - What's in that case?
- I have no clue what's in here. So your chance to win $5 million completely relies on this case
either being safe or eliminated. And you have no clue. Yeah. Best of luck. Now that everyone has a case, it is time to find out
what your fate is. Will that briefcase in front
of you let you move on. Or will it be costing you
this life changing $5 million? Three! Two! One! Reveal! - Congratulations to the
350 of you that see green. But to the 50 of you that see
red, you have been eliminated. I'm sorry, but I need you
to head over to the exit. I thought I was safe. I was not expecting this.
I thought I was going in far. I am safe. I'm actually safe! I did it. I'm safe. This is so amazing. Pink team. You can head back to your lane. Eliminated players, collect your $2,000
and head out. With 50 players already eliminated
from the pink team, we shuffle the briefcases in a new order
and send orange team to the same fate. Alright orange team,
I hope you're all ready for this. Throw up the map! You guys take the
early ones, I'll go far. Okay. I'm really nervous. We're going. One. Two.
Three. Four. Three! Two! One! Go! - Oh my God! I’m shaking.
- Do you trust them? I’m really praying
this is good. Let's see who's going on
to compete for $5 million. Open them up! What’d you get? Yes! Yes! Let’s go! Let's go! With the orange team winners moving on, we, of course, gave
the eliminated players $2,000 each. - Thank you so much.
- Thank you for coming out. - Oh my gosh.
- And send green up to the chopping block. Reveal the map! - I'm going for this one right here.
- I'm gonna go over there. Yellow. You guys nervous back there? Make sure you pay attention.
It's very important. Look at all of them. They're all
studying it as hard as they can. Go! - Yes!
- Yes! Three! Two! One! Reveal! What did you get? While another 50 players
were lost from the green team, I had something extra diabolical
in store for this final round. Yellow team, remember
when I told you to pay attention? Yellow, make sure you pay attention.
It's very important. You guys are going to use
the same pattern green used. But we're only gonna show
the map for a couple seconds. - Man, I can't believe this.
- This is not it. This is so ridiculous. Everybody stand around the edge. That’s it, we’re locking in. Flash the map! I'm going for that one.
I'm going to that first one. Go! Everybody’s strategy
on this one was just to run.  Nobody down there looks confident at all. Alright. Everyone has a briefcase. Let's find out if you're competing
for $5 million... or heading out. Three! Two! One! Open your briefcase. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Let’s go! For those of you that got green, you are all moving on
to the next challenge! - I've got a question!
- What? How does it feel to be winners? And that is the end
of challenge number two. Let's get some rest
before the next challenge. Man, a long day. I finally get to sleep. We're sleeping here by the money.
We're trying to manifest it. We ride together.
We sleep together. We win together. Sleep well, everyone. You're going to need your strength
for this next challenge. I will do whatever it takes
for my family and for my tribe. I don't think there's anything
I wouldn't do to win this money. Congratulations
to all fourteen hundred of you for making it this far. We have two more challenges
in this audition  for my new Prime Video show Beast Games. The rules for challenge three are simple. We are placing flags across
the playing field in front of you. You will need to capture
a flag in order to move on. There's fourteen hundred of you
and eleven hundred flags. This means 300 of you will be eliminated. So we'll be setting out
a different number of flags each round until all
eleven hundred have been captured. But once you cross the red line,
you have to capture a flag or you’re eliminated. You get a flag or you go home.
No $5 million. Run as fast as I can. Get to a flag.
Snatch it as quick as possible. There's only ten flags
on the field for this first round, and there's a lot more
than ten of you. So if you're not
fully committed to go now, - it's your last chance to step back and wait for a better
chance in the later round. I will not go on the first round.
Not go on the second round. Smart. Not go on the third round. Alright, we're about to start round one. What if you both go for the same flag? He better be faster. As soon as I blow this horn,
the round will begin. - Oh!
- Oh, look! Oh! They're running!
Oh! He's going. He's going! Barely anybody went. Oh look those two are racing for flag one. We got a collision. Yeah! Let's go, number ten.
Let's go, number ten, baby! Ten flags were captured
and two people are eliminated. Thank you for coming out. And for the ten of you
who captured a flag, Congratulations!  You secured a spot
in our next challenge. Only 12 people went for this. Yeah, people are way
smarter than I thought I thought hundreds
of people were gonna go. We started off a little tame. Now let's get crazy. For the second round,
we're gonna bring out 50 flags. A lot of people are about
to be eliminated. - You're all going this time?
- Yes. - You’re calling out your flag?
- Yes. I got 47. Do not go to 49.
We got 24. I've been calling 24. They're all picking flags.
They're all trying to be strategic. But, if one person is not on the same
page, you all lose 5 million dollars. Alright. Round two.
50 flags on the field. - Oh! No!
- There it goes! Oh, he went for it. Oh my God!
So many people are getting flags. This is insane. There's only a few flags left.
Who is gonna to get the last one? - Oh my god!
- Yeah! - Have you seen number 20 right there?
- Yes, sir. Let's go. All 50 flags have been captured  and five people
have been eliminated. Remember, the longer you wait,
the worse your odds could get. Let's do this. And they're off.  Oh, boy. Oh! Oh ho oh. It seems that most people who cross
the red line end up getting a flag. And not many people
are actually getting eliminated. I think that's eight eliminates
on that one. I see you all in the back. So you're
thinking if you wait until the end, your odds will be way better. But it's not playing out that way. And with the people on the
front lines calling dibs on their flag. Three-oh-seven.
I have three-oh-seven. Two-seventy-four. Two-eighty-four. - He’s got it.
- I don’t know, I’m going for whatever. The number of flags left is dropping fast. This means the chances of getting
a flag are getting worse and worse. This is insane. - Oh my gosh.
- Oh, no! Who's gonna get the last flag? Oh, no! Oh my God! One of the reasons
people were waiting it out was because they were working together. Their group wants me to put it right here. Okay. Taking turns letting
each other take the flag. - Yeah!
- Oh! It doesn't make sense.
Like, why are people being so nice? It's 5 million dollars. Eventually, you’re gonna have to betray
each other. Someone has to go home. Someone has to go home. And as the rounds go on
and the number of flags left drop, the intensity rises. Oh, oh! They’re both going. But you tripped on yourself. Yeah, I know. - Are you okay?
- Yeah. I mean, this is gotta be
the most insane challenge we've ever done. Oh my God, that's crazy. Yeah! Oh my gosh. Ahh! Let's go! Here's what the line looked like
at the start of the challenge. And look at it now. There's 179 of you left
and only 100 flags. Let's dwindle the numbers a little more.
Bring out 50 flags. This is where the strategy comes out. We only have two rounds left. So you can either go right now or take your chances
in our final round. The question is,
if you wait another round, will your odds get better
or will they get worse? Let's have some fun. And they’re off.
They're going! Get a flag. There are only a few flags left. There it is.
She got it! Yeah! There are 115 people still on the line. This will be the final round. Bring out the 50 remaining flags. There's 115 people left. Only 50 people are going
to make it to this side of the ring. With their spot
at Beast Games on the line, everyone was primed
and ready for our final round. Lock in, lock in. Everyone's locked in.
They're gonna go for it. And in this crucial point
in the competition, I made the worst mistake
I possibly could have.  I handed the mic to my friend Karl. Yo! Let’s hype ‘em up!
What’d I do? Everyone thought you said go, Karl. I said yo. Bro, that was like 50 people
just got out. I said yo! Throughout this whole challenge,
it's been very clear that blowing the horn starts each round.
Not Karl yelling yo! - Wow.
- Thanks Jimmy. I wasn't the one with the microphone.
Holy crap. - Wow. That's brutal.
- Dude, all Karl said was yo. Your 'yo' eliminated 31 people. It's always the air horn.
Why would they leave on yo? You know what cheers up sad people
that just lost a challenge? 2000 dollars. I teamed up with MoneyLion, the easiest
place to borrow, earn, and win money to give the 1000 losing contestants
$2,000 each. But MoneyLion is also giving you
at home a chance to win a lot of money. They're giving away another $1,000
to 1000 lucky winners, totaling in one million dollars. To enter, just scan this QR code or visit moneylion.com/beast games. And finally flag... 1100. After this round,
the challenge is over. The final round
of this challenge... $5 million on the line. Three! Two! One! Oh my gosh! Run! Oh my god! The last flag has been captured. Congratulations to the 1100 of you who are moving on to our final challenge, The most cutthroat challenge yet. It's our final night at Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders. And we're ready for the final trial
before Beast Games. Outside of, like, doing crazy things,
this is a piece of history that I'll always be able
to look back on. That I’ll always be able
to reflect on and say, dude, I am on a MrBeast video. Alright, the 1000 of you that pass this final challenge will move on to compete
in our ten episode Prime Video series. Every single episode
in that show is bigger than
the biggest YouTube video I have ever done. The scale of this show is unbelievable. We built an entire city. We're giving away
a private island and we’ve got the biggest prizes
in entertainment history. But standing between you
and my Beast Games TV show is one final challenge. I need all of you to split up
into groups of 100. This challenge has nothing
to do with strength or speed. It is all about trust. Who you pick could cost you
your spot in Beast Games, and your shot at $5 million. By the end of this challenge,
one of you will betray your entire team. I’m looking for trust but it's hard
to trust when you don't know people. Don’t let people join this line!
And don't leave it. We want more teammates.
I don't even know who he is. I've never talked to this guy. They’re not trusting the rest of
the group and they're coming our group and then they’re not trusting our group.
I don't trust those people. It’s kind of depressing that
my last survival in this competition is based on these people. Who was the last person to join? One of the guys is basically saying, Hey, 10K, I'm an easy buyout. We can't trust him. Can’t trust everybody, but I trust myself.
That's all that matters. I am very confident in
this group we have here. I don't think anybody's gonna fold. We're gonna make it
to that show no matter what. Going to be with people
that are going to Amazon. There's nothing that can make
me turn my back on my team. It’s time for challenge number four. They’re not going
to be cheering much longer. Starting now,
if you step off your platform... you will be eliminated
and so will your entire platform. Everyone knows the rules. Good luck. I will not leave this platform
for anything. All we have to do is outlast those groups. You better not leave.
I’ll get so mad if you leave. - What’re you gonna do about it?
- It's been about a minute and you haven't been eliminated.
That's good. Yeah! Who's the weak link here? Nobody! How’s this corner doin? We don’t want money, Jimmy!
We don’t want money! I didn’t offer money. - Vibes no bribes!
- All right! I believe that we will win! I love how they all have their own chants. Team no deal! I haven't even offered anything.
But I probably will. We will not be bought. Does anybody want to get out? Okay, I guess I'll go get
a bunch of money.  I'll be right back. Honestly, I don't normally
get nervous before filming, but this one is freaking me out. One person is about
to receive a lot of money, and 99 other people
are gonna be very sad. This is gonna be heart wrenching. I brought three separate bribes out here. I'm not offering this right now. To be clear, none of them are in play.
I just want to show you what they are. My first bribe, which is not in effect reveal what the first bribe will be. It will be $5,000. And, no– That ain't no Tesla, bro. If that doesn't work... I'll give you 50 grand! And if somehow, all 1100 of you decline the 5 grand and the 50 grand... Reveal the third offer! Oh my God. $1 million dollars. It's literally one fifth
of the prize money. When that timer starts, the $5,000 bribe will be in play. If anyone wants
to exchange 99 players for five grand, it's right here. Start the timer! I think we got this. I'm just hoping that someone else
on a different team is willing to leave. - Five thousand dollars!
- No! Five grand? I'm trying to give someone five grand. - No!
- No! Nobody wants $5,000. $5,000 is nothing. 5,000 bucks up for grabs. - 5,000? Wait, right now?
- We don’t want it. We don’t want it! Every single team
has declined the five grand. Seems like no one has any interest. You can go ahead and reset the timer.
Put it back to ten minutes. They don't want it. This offer is off the table. For this group of 1100 people, The price of betrayal
was clearly higher than $5,000, but as we got ready
for the next bribe of 50,000, the entire stadium started to change. People on every single platform
were inching closer to the edge, getting ready... to jump. Because everyone here is competing
with one thing on their mind. This amount of money is life changing. To my seven month old baby, Layla,
I love you and I'm doing this for you. If you win $5 million,
what are you spending it on? Finishing my college degree. I’d start an animal rescue. I’d buy my dad a house
because he's a disabled veteran. I'm gonna buy a house
because my house burned down. I quit my job
to be here. Did anyone else quit their job? Wait, why would you do that? They may have said no to $5,000 but $50,000 is a different story. Now, things are gonna
get very interesting. When that timer starts,
whoever touches the ground first. will now receive $50,000. But I did not expect
for this offer to be so irresistible that someone would actually jump
before the timer even started. What!? What? No. It hasn’t started yet. Oh my God. The timer didn't start! She still stepped off. She's not– she's not gonna get it because that timer hadn’t started.
But she stepped off. Oh no... I didn't start the timer yet. - Oh my gosh.
- I don’t get the money? No. Because the timer hadn't started yet. Oh my God. 99 people
just lost out on $5 million. All because she jumped. I'm sorry, but she stepped off. At least wait for the million! Her team was in disbelief
that they had just been betrayed. And they were absolutely devastated that they wouldn't be moving on
to Beast Games. Alright, platform six. You got– - She doesn’t get the money and we lost?
- No. You guys are eliminated. I'm sorry. She stepped off. You guys have
to head to the exit, I'm sorry. That final game was brutal, but it's nothing compared
to what these 1000 remaining contestants are about to face. They've earned their spot in the
biggest competition series of all time! One of them will walk away
with $5 million, but before they do, they will have
to compete in Beast Games! And that concludes this YouTube video, but check this out. Turn on the lights. This is going to be the most insane show you have ever seen in your life. We built an entire city
from the ground up. We're giving away a private island. We have a five million dollar grand prize and we have 1000 players. I finally have the opportunity
to develop characters, tell longer stories, and go beyond YouTube
with a streaming series unlike anything you've ever seen before. If you've ever enjoyed my content, if I can ask you for anything, ever, it would be to watch Beast Games episode
one for free on Prime Video right now. You'll get to see which one
of those thousand people wins this $5 million in cash. I’m gonna start the show. Head over to Prime Video
and watch Beast Games. I am standing on 5 million dollars
of real money. The largest grand prize
in entertainment history."

--------------------------------------------------------------------",MrBeast 2,,People & Blogs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),2024-12-10T17:00:03Z,0:06:39,34975214,20036,,True,"I'm at a grocery store
in Germany and we're going to buy
every single thing in the store. We're doing all of this to promote
the launch of Feastables in Germany. And to celebrate, I brought
the biggest German creators - to buy everything in this store.
- Yeah! Let's go do it! No joke. We are actually buying
everything in this store. Yeah, I guess we just
start grabbing things. Can I take this? - I guess so.
- Can I buy everything? - Grab anything you see.
- Okay. - Okay.
-Just remember, it's all going to charity, and we only have the store for 24 hours. - Let's go!
- Come on, faster. We gotta go faster. All right, now it's time
for the first scan. - How long is your shift today?
- Normally just eight hours. - I might need you all day.
- All day? Well, yeah. We're buying everything. Alright, let’s do it And don't worry we paid the employees
for their longer hours. I'm glad I invited
all these German creators or this literally
would have taken me all day. Be careful it's for charity, man. - This is your gum?
- Yeah, this is my gum. Some of the creators were having
a really good time with the empty store. This is how we eat it
in America. - Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh my God! Ready. Set. Go! - Oh my...
- Yeah! And the rest of them are
helping to clear off the shelves. Attention, shoppers... We have now spent over $ 30,000, which isn't enough. Hurry up! - Nice. Nice doing a good job.
- Thank you! And we're reaching
a little bit of a bottleneck. Look at these carts
the creators grabbed earlier. They're eventually pulled into the back,
where everyone sorts through all the stuff and puts them in boxes
to go to charity. Van number one full. Let's drop it off. Our first
charitable stop was HNU Berlin Nature Preserve, where they rescue animals
and protect wildlife. And we're going to feed some animals. - Bro, they're loving it.
- Jimmy! - Yeah?
- Ronaldo is there. - Are those goats?
- Yeah! And while we were feeding animals,
Karl had a plan of his own. Bring 'em in! We're going to
finish before Jimmy gets back. Once we swap all the
creators with the actual workers all of a sudden, everything
is much quicker, so this was way faster
than I thought. Honestly, we should have gotten
Jimmy to leave earlier. Alright, the next van is loaded up! - Off to the next charity.
- The next batch we sorted will be donated
to Berliner Tiertafel to help families
and individuals care for their pets Back at the store,
let's see what Karl's up to. What happened
while I was gone? - This happened.
- There's still 35 aisles left. Don't look that way.
But we found these. Okay? - Okay.
- You can scan things and it automatically goes to the register
so you don’t have to go anymore. Alright, you know what Karl?
You're actually kind of smart. - We're cheating the system.
- It's like at the grocery store when you try to figure out
which lane has the least people. - Oh, here we go. Perfect.
- We've cleared out these two shelves. They’re working on these shelves,
these are cleared. We're actually starting to make
some meaningful progress. If I cut to the cameras around the store, We literally have an army of people helping us buy this store. There's like, ten people at the cashiers. There's 15 people in
the back sorting through stuff. There's like 15 people
grabbing things off the shelf, And we have like ten people
organizing things in trucks. Fingers crossed, hopefully we can buy
everything by the end of the day. Alright, I'm covering them all up. Oh! That way at the end, it'll be a surprise
how much money we spend. - Oh, that's cool.
- Across the four cash registers, we're around $200,000 deep and we still have
over half the store to go. The number at the end
of this video is not going to be fun. Since sorting and scanning takes too long, The crew grabbed a go cart
to speed things up. - Hey, this is going to hurt.
- Let's go! - Go!
- Go! As we continue to make progress, I want to find some people
to get free groceries. - Do you want to be on one of our videos?
- Yes. Yeah grab the most expensive stuff
you can find. Edeka not only sells Feastables but it also sells our brand new toys,
Mr. Beast Labs. As you can see, the first thing they
went for in the store. That's a good sign. Everything is scanned now.
It costs around about €2,000. Now we're getting everything out here. - Thank you very much.
- Let's go. The cooler trucks are ready
so we have to get going, guys. -Let's go!
- Yeah! Obviously buying everything
in the store and donating to charity
was incredibly expensive. So if you could do me a favor,
go to your Edeka try Feastables. It is the best tasting
chocolate on the planet. I'm totally not biased
and I think you guys will love it. I think right now we're
making really good progress. It seemed impossible
when we started, but these aisles are empty. We only have three aisles left,
and then the entire store is sold out. As word spread about what we were doing, - another creator showed up.
- Bro it looks perfect, man. We’re almost finished! I’ve never seen supermarket
empty like this one. Alright, everybody,
can I have you up here? All the creators I just walked down all the aisles, and they look empty. Except this one. We are on the final aisle - Yeah!
- And we will be able to say we bought everything in an Edeka! Okay, the first one is ready. Look at the efficiency difference. Alright, now we got to unpack it.
This is the challenge. Let's go! Guys, if you drop this,
that's kind of mean to the charity. No! we will drop nothing. Even things like
this frozen section looks small, but there's like ten deep of
each of these, so it takes forever. I'm tired. We saved the best for last, Feastables. I just want to say thank you
to all you guys. You stayed and helped,
you could have left ten hours ago, but you didn’t. I'll throw the channels
on the screen. Just huge shout out to them.
And now that we said that, - Let’s grab all the Feastables.
- Yeah! In case you forgot Feastables is available
in every single Edeka. We came all the way to Germany
to show you just how much we care. Go try them in your local Edeka
I hope you love it. Can't wait to see how much I spent and how long the receipt is,
like we might break a world record. Every shelf in the store is empty.
Now we just need to scan 'em. As you guys know, we've been
scanning on four cash registers. The first one.
Let's see the damage. € 130,895.00 - Oh.
- That’s not too bad for one. - Okay.
- This one is... also a € 130,456. - What?
- This one is a $ 128,000. And for the final cash register... $ 135,000. - with a total of $524,000.
- Yeah! I meant to say euro,
sorry my American kicked in. Hey, everybody!
Here’s the receipt! - Alright, who wants to grab the end?
- Yes! Right here, grab that side. Here can you grab this side
and walk it over there? - Just keep walking.
- Oh, wow. This is the receipt.
We had a staple bunch together. It keeps going, and it ends all the way
on the other side of the store here. - That is crazy.
- This is crazy. Literally every single one
of the thousands of items we bought is helping someone in Germany. And the only thing we did not buy
was alcohol products, since it can't be donated to charity. Some went to Welcome Baby Bags
for new moms and babies. Refugio for refugees needing shelter. and Die Arche Berlin
for kids needing meals as well as countless
other amazing organizations Strassenfeger, Heils-Armee,
Kältehilfe Berlin, Berliner Tiertafel, Berliner Engel,
Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund, HNU Berlin, Unionhilfswerk
and Suppernküche Franziskaner are receiving support, offering hope
and relief to those who need it the most. This is about so much more than giving, it's about changing lives, providing comfort to the vulnerable and showing that compassion
can be felt everywhere. And finally, we are now done!
Thank you everybody! We bought everything in an Edeka! If you live in Germany, please buy
Feastables. This was a lot of work."

Bies we have to go easier it's fair and you guys got kind of mad so you know what that means boys does that mean no mercy target the besmirched no mercy no stop having mercy no mercy stupid gone car it's been gone I'd like to point out that Chris's defenses are much slower than mine oh really everybody's getting deleted every time Chandler how's your job you know I'll just be watching the boys Oh Oh Carl one got through Oh Carl you one got through no one has scored in five minutes guys I said we go a little easier on ya I'm gonna just close my eyes and then I'll just click the button and whoever dies dies yeah I'm not gonna move anymore so I let him go oh hey hey boom all right Chandler's in first place because he keeps accidentally walking into oh my goodness Chandler I'm trying to let some go through him use only the sword now Carl switch your sword let's be nice oh oh my gosh it's so much harder I'm gonna stand here and kill people all right there's a lot of people getting through oh hey it's um Squidward let's see if they just walk into my sword whoo handsome Squidward oh look people are literally just walking into my sword sorry sorry everybody sorry everybody I'm killing I didn't mean to Oh dharna actually kills handsome Squidward not an subscribe word yeah I'm gonna stand here and just whack people whack whack whack oh okay all right know what go through go through guys alright we're going back to being easy on besmirch wait Carl yes did you dig a tunnel no Chris did you dig one no I didn't dig a tunnel Chandler did you know there's a tunnel here who took this who Doug dimmadome to that all right here I'm gonna put lava here just to screw the cheaters I'm using hacks guys I'm just blowing up the map now guys I thought of a genius plan what if we just did this now they can't xscape wait where's everything let's see if our defenses work oh oh how did he do that oh wait wait how'd they get another tunnel oh it's somebody's giving him a tunnel who's building this stuff I promise it's actually not me this time so I think someone's competing wait so you're saying one of these people competing has creative Oh we're hitting each other up they're hitting each other up only the biggest of the brains are winning right now ten seconds left come on guys ten grands on the line I'm putting creepers to blow people in there all right round over como como round one is over everyone is trapped here open the gates boys let's show them what round twos gonna be about we have this insane obstacle course for them to go through but the thing is we left the sides open so they don't actually have to do this obstacle course but if they go around the side to have to deal with Chris or coral so this is what the mazes they climb up here they bounce they go here they jump they climb then they jump jump climb up if you miss it you got to start over and then you get up here and you jump into the water go through the middle what are you doing guys you're gonna die well I mean they have options it's so weird because the same thing we'll keep going through there and dying like you think they would learn after a while what we're trying to do here is not make this straightforward we're trying to have intelligence play a role the left and the right side are open but every five seconds creepers explode oh man so how many times are they gonna try to go through here before they go through the only open path a bunch of silly willies they're hitting each other in the lava bill it way through currently is the obstacle course the left and right side are just illusions oh wait oh wait he made it through whoa Haley there is a way to get through I am the judger I judge currently croisine is in first with a decent lead you know what this obstacle course is too easy I'm gonna make it harder all right like always since this is second round they get 20 points per score the blazes they're like dodgeball throwing at them you guys are so cruel this is ten grand it's not supposed to be easy Chandler I have a plan come with me okay let's destroy some of this glass and snipe through it shot mr. beast already won a video yeah that's right you better burn make sure no previous winners win target them yeah we hate previous yeah targeting whoa croisine you will not a new wave is spawning through I kept them in spawn for a little while now they're coming through as hard as they can Boyka Pinkus zoink u-joint you you know what sucked for these people were getting by some blazes uh-oh shot mr. beast kill them kill him do not let him win again I got him I got him in the butt oh no that guy got killed by creepers I feel bad that was all my fault there's always be saying he feels bad right after doing something very intentionally a lot of people just made it through the right side yeah the right side apparently can be exploited if you hug the wall is that how Castro no I got a head yeah only the smartest survive man all right let's make this way harder let's put creepers all over all right I gotta get some let's get a couple of these bad boys all right what a ghast in here why are there just gas wouldn't it be rude to put a Ravager in the maze what if I did this look the gas is blocking the entrance right here oh my god he's sitting there chilling what this is probably the hardest one we've ever done currently I've blocked off all paths there's no way to score wait these people are just taking damage through the lava with him old lame or Carl Chandler you guys go see if you could score all you guys play oh come on a blaze hit me in midair wait there's only 20 seconds left I'm gonna do it it creative I'll do it and creative let me see I'm doing oh I just didn't fly them up the ladder I guess oh no I'm doing it I'm doing it rounds over no more scoring no more scoring no more scoring no more story Jimmy will get made it to the end that is the end of round 2 Chris how do you feel I feel like we've got a really good job accomplished we didn't let hardly anyone through Castro you are currently in the lead with 200 points as of right now you would hypothetically win the 10 grand if the video was over how does that make you feel I'm feeling pretty confident money if you lost would you be sad why don't you stand you know no ran three just walk away right now just you're right actually let's do that that's it for this video I'm blocking off this side of the map and I'm blocking off this side of the map Carl I want you to join in the competition and see if you can win Oh bye okay boy Jedi I know I've been killing you but now I'm on your team now before we start the third round Chris Chandler come over here let's switch to survival mode and let's see if we can beat this what just show you how it's done I want us to attempt this so we understand what they're going through all right thanks a lot Chris Chris hey hey dude oh how are you supposed to get that jump all you got to be hop it alright I know what to do Oh Chandler got it Oh do you guys respect it contestants more now uh nah I'm gonna try one more time boom boom then you come here then you go bada boom bada BAE Wow anyways the point is this is really hard so whoever gets this money deserves it go to the end and make this way harder do whatever you want say no more start the next round left side is blocked off right side is blocked off one way through $10,000 okay this might be a little bit illegal but I like to cheat because I've never won yo this last round is worth a lot more points good luck everybody and they're off to the races let's see how it goes I don't know why these people think that they can get through over this way they can't but we're gonna hide here for a second so nobody sees us do this oh I can't place a block they're all falling dude whoever makes it through is just pure luck Oh hockey buns hockey buns hockey but no oh this guy or whatever its ik what he's a guy huh okay I actually want to try okay oh can he make that complicated jump yeah oh no don't stand in it you got a jump I'm sad this is impossible this is the new segment I call Chris trying to pronounce names Chris what's this guy's name uh that guy is a growed what's this guy's name his name is Jim am prov oh wait drum said it what's this guy's name that is um le no that's um dead and that concludes Chris trying to pronounce names you guys have no idea how difficult this is it's like everybody's working against each other there's people that have sacrificed winning $10,000 just to make sure nobody else can get through I'm so annoyed the target Karl ah they're giving up their chance to win money just to make me sad guys you guys stay over there so it's not too suspicious I'm going to make a secret tunnel oh wow wait there chasey karl is literally come to spawn Christy p2b planet there's people literally chasey like they have Carlton town they're going after it why are they going to have to him stop haha you noob wait I got a hold up let me try that no oh we should a hundred percent just pay them just for doing I should hire someone just to kill Carl every I will kill you I'll murder you all this is a last round that's four minutes left this is where they spawned I'm gonna do a super secret thing damn he'll see if he doesn't let's see if Carl does it [Music] Donham oh my god somebody was making me a tunnel hahaha Chris make a bunch a quote unquote secret tunnels but it's just holes secret tunnel initiative he just he just walked away from it oh he felt Castro is still in first he did manage to score look at all this right here isn't this beautiful oh look a diamond on the ground give me that oh my Chris time to just literally pull holes in the ground that if they go in they're stuck I'm just gonna wait for Carl to come out and snipe them every time I see you you fall in the hole you die Carl's flying comes flying whoa cheater let me move out the way you know what about the type go

About Buckshot Roulette:

BUCKSHOT ROULETTE is a tabletop horror game that attempts to re-design the infamous game of Roulette, replacing the traditional revolver with a proper 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. This extra firepower, and more importantly the different mechanics in handling a shotgun compared to a revolver, offers a fresh take on the classic game of chance.

The game takes place at the top of an underground club, where the metal railings tremble to the pulse of long lost drum machines. A crooked AI dealer is waiting for you.

In this DanTDM video, I play a Dog Game, Peppa Pig and Minecraft with my Son, Asher. This is my favourite video that I have ever made, so let me know what you think ♥",DanTDM,"dantdm,dan tdm,gaming,video games,minecraft,funny",Gaming,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture",2022-03-19T18:00:07Z,0:11:08,22222196,40139,,True,this is my son asha he's two years old and i think he might be insane and this is me i've been playing video games ever since i was young and gaming is a huge part of my life who i am as a person and my career and i want to try sharing that passion with my son ash's favorite things right now consist of cars diggers food and animals so let's start there i tried to pick three games to show him that would relate to those interests the first was a game where you look after and play with a dog the second's was peppa pig she's an animal i guess my personal favorite minecraft because it's peaceful it's creative and it also has a lot of animals in right i'm missing a child so uh let's go and get him [Music] how should you want to see tato yeah you want to see tato are you sure yeah okay this is tato he's our virtual chihuahua puppy who we look after on the switch we have two dogs of our own who asha adores but they're still getting used to a heavy-handed toddler so tato is the next best thing now we tried to film this in our living room and it was okay yeah but i literally have a room dedicated to gaming so i got to work making an asha friendly gaming space who's that yeah did you play some games within two minutes his face was two inches away from the screen but he loved it should we make him sit yeah there we go look it's sitting and then we can get the brush yeah and we can brush tato potato was a frisbee catching champion in the making so he needed a good diet so we needed to feed him what should we feed tate we can do chicken cow or fish cow cow right here goes the cow food ready and it goes and feed feed cow he's eating cow tato has consumed an entire cow which gives him enough energy for frisbee practice should we throw a frisbee do you want to help throw it ready oh well done you did it look he's going to try and catch it oh he just missed asha threw the perfect throw and tato missed i don't believe it anyway i'd say his first gaming experience was a positive one so a few days later we decided to try something new [Music] i'm not gonna lie to you i was actually going to play this game for a video myself but then i took a step back and asked myself yo what are you doing what are you doing also we don't watch peppa pig i've seen what this pig gets up to and some of it is um is questionable now it's my turn i win again like why is she so aggressive let's not even begin on the fat shaming of the dad you've got a big tummy daddy is there a baby in there anyway pepper is a pig asha likes pigs so let's see what he thinks right you ready to play yeah look who's this puppy pig yeah and who's this one do you remember is it me no no well then we're gonna make our own friend right let's choose a color do you want blue purple pink green brown you want brown yeah okay what face would you like okay and what color would you like the rabbit to be this one gray yeah okay do you want glasses on the rabbit yeah we have daddy's glasses yeah yeah what about a hat yeah do you want to point to which one you want which one this one yeah or this one this one this one this one this one this one this one this one police hat yeah police rabbit was ready to go and the first task opening a gate what's that a butterfly butterfly bye bye butterfly should we follow it yeah let's go there's a fence in the way should we open the gate yeah okay can you press this button for me well i know you opened the gate [Music] and once i taught him how to press the space bar i just simply wasn't allowed to anymore oh you're pressing the wrong button oh no that's the wrong mouse no don't press it oh no oh no this is bad this is bad actually i saved the recording which was good because now it's time to focus for the running race and there is no way no way i am letting peppa pig beat me in a good old-fashioned foot race yeah we're going to do some running go why are you blowing it again yeah are we going to win yeah we're at the front we're in first place we won high five yeah take that pepper yes first place i think i need to calm down let's do some relaxing drawing what is he drawing asha it's a rainbow he's added some grass too it will look great on peppa's wall oh look can you see our rainbow what can you see that's our rainbow can you see any other drawings what's this one fluff yeah what about this one outside yep this one yeah what about this one well done what noise is an elephant mate [Music] after about 15 minutes ash was bored are you finished playing can daddy play this some more i don't really want to and as soon as i stopped recording the first thing asha wanted to do was go and see tato which went really well how are you tato are you good yep that that's my laptop now since ashley loves animals i thought minecraft would be perfect we got pigs we got chickens we got cows you get the idea but it got even better when i thought about bedrock edition normally i don't like minecraft bedrock edition because i'm a java guy but for younger players bed recognition is actually really good we go to the farm as a family all the time it's one of ash's favorite things to do so i searched farm up on the minecraft marketplace and i found this crazy good free map [Music] what kind of animals would you like to see at the farm pigs well luckily yeah there's a car over here what else can you see yeah that is a doggy look we can make him stand up he's got a tail he's walking it's a cockle that is a cockroach what do cockroaches say [Music] oh look there's a person here yeah oh no what did i pick up what do i pick what's that asha a cow that's not a cow this is though look hello cow hello [Music] oh look at that it's a little chick all right let's go see some pigs yeah look there's a pig oh look at it [Music] it's falling over what's it doing i did not know pigs could do that in this game that was cool we're gonna need a pig noise yeah that's funny isn't it right would you like to drive a tractor look it's david he's driving we're driving the tractor that's cool isn't it ah ready oh got steering wheel there we go you guys driving your car's your favorite bit yeah then i had a very rare brainwave i searched cars up on the minecraft marketplace and asha made his choice of what to play next this was you want this one yeah good choice are you having fun yeah yeah this is cool isn't it school plants cool farms oh look because which car should we drive first we've got purple red or white white let's do it whoa we're driving it oh it's fast it's really fast blue one blue one this one there we [Music] we're go it this one's really fast honestly he could have just watched us drive around for well ages but i did need to know the answer to something would you like better cars or farms cars cars okay wasn't the answer i was expecting to be honest but there was one more thing that i wanted to show asha and it's one of his newest interests dinosaurs all right let's go over here and there's dinosaurs this one i don't actually know what this is i'm gonna say spinosaurus oh that is insane you see i i got it right should we see we can find a t-rex oh they're eating each other oh they're fighting they're fighting look let me put another t-rex here look big t-rex there's a pterodactyl i found one yeah what dinosaur is this one carnotaurus that's a big word that's actually kind of cool a dodo oh oh no oh no dinosaurs are um kind of aggressive yeah what's what's happening to the duck oh no and that's when his toddler attention span faded away and he decided to beat up my microphone overall i think this was actually pretty successful being able to show him how to explore his interests in a brand new way was really fun and in short bursts he enjoyed it too and it's another way that i can share one of my passions with him i think it's safe to say that tato was definitely his favorite he still asks about him every day but don't you worry i haven't been building mansions mansions in minecraft in no time thank you so much for watching this video i massively appreciate it if you can leave a like if you enjoyed that be awesome subscribe if you're brand new as well and i'll see you in the next one alright bye

Ludo King is a friends and family game that was once played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. You'll be playing this Ludo for hours and its fun for the whole family.

Ludo King is a perfect time pass game of Ludo board game. You played Ludo in your childhood, now play on your phone and tablet.

Another nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King. 

Ludo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Chakka, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo.

we're less than 20 years away from climate collapse and for me that's that's incredibly scary both for our future but for my children's future it struck me that there was such an opportunity to use these games that were reaching hundreds of millions of people to to create awareness about what's happening in the world so when you play Longleaf Valley you're restoring and saving a national park and then as you're playing you're actually collecting tree tokens to plant a real tree our players together have planted over 1.6 million trees now but it's amazing to know that together we are making

comforting or affecting us through video games in fact 25 years ago back in college I started writing a series of Articles called behind the games chronicling the development of games like halflife and Metal Gear Solid 2 because I knew games were nothing without the people behind them now the sad reality is that over the past few years the gaming industry has suffered significant and unprecedented industrywide layoffs those fect the games we get to play and even more importantly the people who make the games we love we can debate and certainly disagree with the reasons why and honestly as a show we we kind of struggle with how to address these topics in a constructive way but this year inside of these challenges we found greatness I'm proud to share with you the story of a single individual who saw developers in need and did something truly extraordinary meet tga's first ever Game Changer starting in early 2023 significant waves of layoff started in the games industry

the night over the past decade 10 distinguished titles have been recog ized as game of the year please welcome last year's winner from laran Sven [Applause] [Music] [Applause] vinka I realize you guys have been sitting here for over 3 hours but I still have some time credits from last year to cash in so so it turns out that not only will I be the one who will know as first first which game wins tonight they actually also know which game is going to win next year the year after and the year after now how do I no this well an oracle told me she said change is coming it's a modern Oracle so they made me sign an NDA but I trust all of you I know you can keep a secret you will never leak it the Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by studio studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage it's stupid simple but somehow it keeps on getting lost Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves they created it because it hadn't been created before they didn't make it to increase market share they didn't make it to Ser as a brand they didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they me didn't meet those targets and furthermore the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design they didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet they didn't treat their players as users to exploit and they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics they knew that if you put the game and the team first the revenue will follow they were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun and they realized that if the developers didn't have fun nobody was going to have any fun they understood the value of respect that if they treated their developers and players well those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned but above all they cared about their game because they loved games it's really that simple said the Oracle winning game of the year turned out to be a lifechanging event for us it was an amazing thing to those who will win game of the year 2024 you have no idea what's waiting for you it's an incredible honor and you're in for a heck of a ride now remember should you be told to wrap it up for tonight you can always come back next year and chat for three minutes okay so now to pay tribute to the nominees nominees for game of the year once again Lura Bal and the TJ Orchestra [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] aesome [Music] El [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the game of the year is astrobot [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

again to all the ases back in Japan you know all 65 of them right now they're crying so please a round of applause for them thank you it's you guys as um you know when I thought about you know why this game you know give people joy and smiles on their faces I think he came down to the people every day making the game and doing exactly that I think you know when I think of the team is the amount of generosity they gave they put the user first always you know never thought about any you know any calculation it was just about the kids especially because we had this huge huge privilege to be potentially the first game to be in the hands of children and we know what it means very much um so timas be really uh from the bottom of her heart you know well done and thank you so much now thank you I have to thank a few more people because a lot of people contributed to this game of course in si and Playstation or family you know Herman who give you know the studio a chance and Scott Roy who really believe in Astro even before we did Ken Chanel marketing and many many other people that I'm not mentioning you know astrobot is full of 30 years of PlayStation history and actually a lot of people in this room tonight gave their characters their IP without asking anything in return just because they cared about celebrating 30 years so to them as well you know from the bottom of our heart thank you so much and then last and not least and you want to stay for this one because I didn't plan to say it but I'm going to say it anyway you know Platformers you know PlayStation 30 years and we made a platformer which is great it's very nostalgic and and fresh at the same time but let's not forget that even before PlayStation there were people making Platformers I remember I was a kid in 1989 Christmas and I got a gray box there was a g packed in he was Co Super Mario Brothers and he was really really great so we are in Japan we're in Tokyo they are in Kyoto but I want to pay tribute to the company who really put like Platformers and show us Innovation and quality consistently and inspired us to actually make the game that we made so that's also and I've managed not to mention them have you noticed but you all know who they are and many other companies have been inspired over the years so that's really very important and we want to Tri you know pay tribute to them um tonight so From The Bottom Of Far thank you so much it's amazing and uh we'll see you again thank you so much [Applause] [Music] congratulations astrobot and that is going to do it for our 10th

I have a history of building the best streaming setups in the world including Adin Ross and Kai Cenat! Today, it’s iShowSpeed’s turn! This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! iShowSpeed loved his new Renaldo themed gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

Not I Built Kai Cenat His Dream Gaming Room, But I Challenged iShowSpeed to a 1v1 Soccer Game, But Youtubers Control My Life for 24 Hours *Extreme*, But I Built iShowSpeed His Dream Gaming Room, But iShowSpeed's NEW $100,000 Setup Reveal, But I Built Adin Ross His Dream Gaming Room, But my friends room was messy so I Built His DREAM Room, But IShowSpeed REVEALS His New $100,000 Gaming Setup, But a fan wanted to hang out So I Built His DREAM Gaming Room, But xQc Reacts to iShowSpeed's $100K New Stream Setup, But NEW SETUP REVEAL or any other video like Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, Papa Jake, FilmDice, LOL Team, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, Faze Rug, IShowSpeed, xQc Clips, Kay, Live Speedy, Agent 00 Everything or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a new gaming and streaming room for iShowSpeed!

speed's house iow speed is the most popular streamer on the planet and he loves soccer but doesn't have a place to play right speed if I'm going to be able to surprise you with your new room first I need you out of here look I'm going on Australia Tour by the time I come back the room better be ready and it better be good don't my room bro I'll be back this room is actually massive but it needs a lot of work his entire gaming setup is broken but that's why he called us we're going to be fixing everything inside of this room first things first I think we're going to have to remove speed's bed so we can actually pay soccer in here this room has so much potential for a giant soccer field it's going to look insane in here we're going to start off by building a custom wooden frame for this wall and we'll add a hidden entrance right there we're lifting our first wall in place now that we have speed's room all framed up we're going to go inside of the hallway and cover it up at the end so it looks like a dead end almost just hit the roof it's so heavy I've seen speed get mad before and I definitely don't want to get hit mad at me you got to you trolling you have one week to pull up this boy we're going to add some hinges on the back of this so it actually opens into the room hinges are installed now that we have the hinges installed it's time to see this baby work ready yo nice how long have you been standing there uh for a while just kind of watching since we have a beautiful luxury painting of Ronaldo out there it's time to give this wall the same treatment with a luxury wood finish what are you doing right now I'm just making sure everything's up to code what code are you following [Music] this wooden wall with the hidden entrance is looking amazing and the rest of the room is looking extremely messy which technically is a soccer player but it's not a soccer field and I want a soccer field inside a speed's room so we got to do that I'm really sorry I show speed but all of this has to go just for a little bit I promise it's going to look amazing in here soon while we were busy working on the soccer field speed arrived in Australia we are here in all thrill here you want CH this is a kangaroo can I race him yo bro you want to race huh 20 M all right I'm about to jump off this Australian Cliff this room is looking really clean so I'm going to call my friend foot crunch who's a soccer YouTuber to tell me everything that we need to put in here to make it an official soccer field inside of speed's house oh you need grass you need a gold I want to get a lot of flags to represent every country a Ronaldo shirt pob shoes not Cleaves and you need a foot and Matthew whatever you do don't put any messy stuff there we're going to start off by adding a grass floor across the Entre those are Minecraft blocks we're going to be adding real grass that's not going to cut it every one of these pieces hits exactly like a puzzle this is going to look amazing this is the last spot that needs to be grab now we vacuum the soccer field where'd you get that thing I got it right next to speed's Lamborghini in the garage you went by his Lamborghini Matthew's upstairs he don't even know I'm down here in speed's garage I might or may not have sat in it oh oh my gosh we're about to install customade lockers behind me right here because when we first entered speed's room he had jerseys hanging all over the place now he'll have an official place to display all of his signed soccer jerseys I'm pretty sure he has a signed Ronaldo Jersey how cool would it be to have that hanging on the wall while you're playing soccer these lockers are extremely heavy we got to bring it all the way over there everything that we're putting inside of this room was custom built back at our warehouse in Colorado Just For Speed perfect we have our first Locker installed right here and this hidden entrance is looking incredible on the outside but inside the room looks pretty terrible so we're about to add another Locker right there that also opens as another hidden exit to leave his room so this looks like a normal Locker right here but it actually is speed's new Doorway to go back outside so it's actually really cool I saw a picture of Ronaldo's Locker in his locker room and it looks exactly like this that was our inspiration so now speed has an exact replica of Ronaldo's Locker inside of his room it's time to start decorating the lockers with all this stuff right here and the coolest part is I can just throw everything into place bro it actually worked let me keep throwing actually I don't want to throw these ones they're really nice this looks amazing now let's decorate speed's Locker the Jersey we're hanging up on this Locker is a game worn soccer jersey from speed wait he wore that M smells like strawberries our custom Locker are looking amazing we even added these lights to make these glow watch this that looks amazing I chose the red for Ronaldo side because it matches perfectly with the jersey that looks so good and then if you come over here I chose blue cuz it matches speed's Jersey perfectly so these are all the items I'm going to be using to customize speed soccer field looks like I already broke some I have a bunch of country flags sports jerseys and memorabilia that I'll be hanging on the wall to decorate the room before we customize in here I'm going to take this tape down really fast it's a d this wall is really boring right now so we're going to add some details as we were adding the flags we heard someone talking outside of the room is that speed Matthew I'm home it's going to be a lot harder to keep this room a surprise with speed being home we got to finish this room quick we all know that Ronaldo is the best soccer player so I'm going to hang this up right here be loves Ronaldo but I love Messi you are crazy bringing that thing in here I love him so much that I'm going to make a giant Shrine for Messi in the middle of speed's room all right I'm going to set this little guy here I'm going to hang my Argentina Jersey on the wall yeah your room was dirty before but now it's messy watch this here I go a little ey up it if speed sees this he is going to be very mad what is they doing in my room no you can't go in there again get the off me bro no no this is my room and this is where I stream at bro it's a minute longer we just got a minute just a minute longer that's all we need bro I got y 10 minutes bro I got topish thankfully our cameraman Brandon convinced speed not to come inside the room so he didn't see the messy painting on the wall now that we have speed's room looking much better we're going to add some white paint to the ground and some gold so it actually can transform into a soccer field if I mess up this line we're all out of grass so this is my last attempt this line is so big it's going to take forever to paint it we have this stencil that we made right here to get the perfect circle in the middle of the field what is that right there oh it's genin impact the sponsor of today's video Moment of Truth to see if this actually looks good so far this looks amazing let's check out the last stencil oh I know that that looked easy and it's because it was now this wouldn't be a soccer field if speed couldn't score any goals so that's what we're about to add right now we're almost there I would help but my hands are tied this is so heavy no go to properly put this soccer field to the test we're getting ready to play a game and I got my soccer helmet on so it's game on I'm a goalie now oh oh while we were busy playing soccer I show speed gave me another insane challenge all right Matthew this is what I want I love anime do I love one piece that is pretty much what I like no messy I don't want no no Argentinian no number 10 no nothing no messy the soccer field is looking incredible but speed wants to add some anime elements into the room so we have a lot more work to do so this wall right here is the most important wall in the entire room because this is the background that all of speed's viewers see when he's going live so I want to add something crazy in that middle spot right there but we need to address this side over here first I'm really sorry speed but these got to go oh hi where did you come from I was just chilling back here watching you guys hey if anyone wants these curtains I'm selling them on eBay so a few weeks ago speed face me and told me one of the most important things that we cannot mess up is we have to get rid of the echo inside of this room for when he's streaming so that's what we're about to do right now sound check no matter how loud speed is the sound is not leaving this room since we're building the ultimate gaming room for Speed and he loves anime we have the perfect sponsor for today's video gansin impact we're going to be putting a custom LED one piece sign right there that almost hit them it's so funny trying to explain an edit to Uncle Davey has no idea what's going on so there's an edit where there's something there right now there's something there right now I don't see it but eventually pinga it's going to show up there we have this super dope custom one piece sign speed is going to love it and the coolest part is there's LEDs on the back and genin impact is an award-winning open world action role player game the coolest part about this custom sign main is it actually glows check it out it it's it didn't turn on no you're supposed to turned on bro oh my bad sorry right now speed's desk is looking a little Dusty and boring so I'm going to make an electro slime from gin impact and put it on his desk [Music] what kind of controller is this it's funny that you asked that Uncle Dave because that is an Xbox controller and now genin impact is available on Xbox and plenty of other things when you log in on Xbox you win a free win glider to show off your style me BTO and Noah are wiring everything up so we can start playing the game I'm the first person to play a new game in speed's room well they're playing against an impact I'm going to prank Uncle Dave check this out going keep going hey Uncle Dave can you do me a favor for the brand deal and read off the next line keep reading this if you're clueless do you get it unle anyways Xbox players get cross saave functionality you can switch seamlessly between your Xbox and other devices why does Uncle Dave look so confused right now you can switch controllers too I said devices you can switch the game between devices that's a device oh those devices I'm playing gin impact in the video game and they're playing gchen impact in real life jeez please don't drop the sword on my head version 5.2 is bringing new adventures new and it includes two amazing new characters oron and the five star chisa who can fly her weapon and Traverse in the skies like never before anything I do in the game Uncle day is going to do in real life jump jump this game is made for anyone for any age unle D's going to try he hasn't played a video game since the'80s this game is awesome I like my video games dppy bro we got these custom one piece art pieces it's a lot of pieces they're extremely hard to hang up but it's speed's favorite show so he's going to love it believe it or not installing those art pieces took hours if Uncle Dave has it moved once that's how fun gench and impact is I love gench and impact it's addicting I thought you've been staring at the screen for so long but look up and look at what we added when did you guys put that up I think we should transform this entire wall and add TVs LED panels and a giant custom iow speed shelf right there all right the lights are about to turn on ready yes okay three 2 1 let's go that looks so good come on we're going to go ahead and build a custom lightning bolt since speed is the fastest crater on the planet right there our lightning bolts like this but it needs to be like this so we either need to raise this side or lower that side and perfectly balanced as all things should be didn't say that so right now the inside of the bolt looks empty but that's why we have this thing right here it's actually the same design from isow speed's Prime B this lightning bowlt is looking incredible but it's missing speed's name watch this I'm a magician so our next step is installing TVs wo wow I still caught that somehow you know what's better than one TV know what what two TVs oh the room is starting to look amazing however this wall still needs a lot of work but before we address that I have a prank to set up for Speed so for the inside of this room we are actually going to be pranking speed I have a bunch of different messy merchandise and other things to completely troll him and make him as mad as possible so this right here is my favorite item in the fake room we have a fake lookalike Ronaldo and I even left the water marks and stock images on it to make this image look as horrible as possible I custom made this jersey that says 77 and we misspelled Ronaldo everything in this room is cursed I can guarantee everything in this room is going to get broken no way did all that for them I just hope he doesn't break my camera I hope he doesn't break me so in order for a prank to be good and for it to actually work you need them to actually believe it's real so also adding some things in here that he likes like Luffy Portugal flags soccer ball lights so he actually believes it for a second too I'm going to make this a sign knuckle day Ral shirt this is about to be a PSA 10 sign Jersey I use a pencil in case I'm messed up so I can erase it so now that we have this prank room set up for Speed he's going to hate this room let's go do something that he'll actually love which is a themed wall to Ronaldo this wouldn't be an iow speed room if we didn't represent Ronaldo in here so we're going to add a giant number seven right there with the Portugal colors and iow speed across the top let's get to [Music] painting what are you doing I love messy what is that noise is my R coming he's coming we cover up the messy painting extremely fast and convince speed to not come into the room until we surprise him we got our framing done on this wall now we can do the next step which is adding the giant white sheets over it this is actually so heavy but it's going to make the wall look great Uncle Dave can you hand me a drill yeah I'm uh still playing the game though as you can see this is a Ronaldo themed wall but it's missing one thing the number seven yeah pretty cool right what are you wearing Jersey at this point Noah just wants speed to hate him and I don't think Uncle Dave even knows where he's at no let's just hang up the seven this is actually about to look insane that looks so good after adding all the LEDs it was time to install isow speed's name we're going to add speed's name to the top so it looks like an official jersey here we go the only problem is I'm the only one tall enough to reach it so our little messy friend over here is going to need a ladder they just installed the LEDs I'm going to test them out taada they're lit oh my God you got that one let's move on to the next phase which is lunch so earlier on I show speed gave me a challenge to add some anime features in this room and we do have to cover up that spray paint right there so what if we custom sculpted a Luffy head since that's speed's favorite show we're going to be using these phone blocks to sculpt a giant Luffy face since that's I show speed's favorite anime and I'm going to use this saw to sculpt the details on his face this is the jawline of somebody that Muse daily and I would know that because I do that too now that we have this anime head all sculpted we're going to paint it and the only place there's enough room is inside of speed's bathroom the shower is big in my house feed is going to absolutely love this this is literally his profile picture on YouTube and now this sculpture is going to be above his B I'm about to paint Luffy's iconic hat and Brandon has me covered I'm the model reference can you put your head down a little bit Yeah Noah literally spent days sculpting this thing right here now it's time to install it on the wall if you're ever watching one of iow speed streams just know it actually says messy behind this after we hang this up can we watch the HW Tua podcast why this room is looking incredible but this table kind of sucks so we have something much better back home in Colorado we actually made a custom Luffy fist that's going to double as his desk we removed speed's old desk and went down to our box truck to grab our new custom desk this is a giant custom desk we made Just For Speed it's time to bring it in the house this is going to be a nightmare to carry upstairs there's a super small staircase and we have to be careful not to bump anything in his Mansion I don't know I actually do this oh I really hope that's the bubble wrap this is insane so we still have to paint this desk to make it actually look like Luffy's hand but he is going to love this so on that wall over there we have Luffy's face and on this side we have his fist punching a wall now we just have to paint it and soon we can actually surprise speed this is going to look so good when I'm done with it this is actually starting to look so good we're adding the final touches inside of this room so we can surprise speed but it's not much of a streaming room if there's no setup right here so we're about to change that I ordered an extremely crazy custom one of one PC that we're going to put right there huge shout out to my friends at Paradox Customs for sending us this super computer for I show speed inside of this custom PC we have a ton of different details like on the outside we laser etched his name and on the inside we have different screens that have some of speed's most iconic moments we're about to add the centerpiece to this entire room and it's a giant soccer ball chandelier that goes right there on the roof it's extremely heavy so hopefully it doesn't fall or break we just got to get these screwed in and then we can can let go now all we have to do is turn on the lights and I'll show you how this thing works so that's what you call an infinite mirror right there once we installed the infinity mirror it was time for the finishing touches hey look what I found in the garage next to the lambo It's a poster of some kind that's very expensive now I'm going to add this super cute OT from genjin Impact don't forget y oh okay I had to put him up here they so cute I love them I was watching one of speed streams when he was inside of this room and he typically uses a green screen a lot so I wanted to install one that he could easily move so we added a pull down Green Screen mechanism so it's super easy for him to have a green screen whenever he wants I hope the editors put something funny right there I know Steed has the cutest little puppy ever so I had to get something for them that's the perfect touch to this room now it's ready for Speed and speed St so before I go downstairs and grab speed to surprise him I want to see what his streaming setup's actually going to look like so we got somebody Uncle Dave is going to be our test subject to see how the streaming setup actually looks the chariot awaits Uncle Dave oh we're going to SP Uncle Dave is the first person that sit in I show speed's new streaming setup yeah all right we're just setting this camera up are we live I'm actually very glad that we're not live because Uncle Dave requires a lot of edits Bazinga huille I need two hot dog stats should I start barking like Steve obviously we're going to be surprising speed at the end of this video but I want to surprise his uncle first and thanks to GH and impact we're going to be surprising with the Xbox $1,000 his favorite snacks because he's been letting us in the house every single day so let's go surprise thanks to genin impact I was able to surprise speed's Uncle with some amazing gifts and get his reaction to the room Beam Team Uncle Wayne Speed game this is beautiful man we have managed to add a soccer field inside of speed's house but now we got to put a bed in here so it's a soccer bedroom [Music] here they need to hurry up so I can take a nap on speed's bed this bed is massive after weeks of hard work it's finally time to grab is show speed and get his reaction let's go grab it all right you ready yeah I'm ready like I never got my setup even made so let's just hope it's a dream setup leave you in okay I got you you ready yeah all right I hope you like this all right

to bite me yeah all right little guy be free go bye little one we'll see you later all right well uh let's get back to work so Drew we're gonna need to bust down that wall in order to get to the other basement that's bigger than this one sir yes sir oh keep hitting it keep hitting it oh  dude who broke the pipe oh Bro oh I don't know your hands I just turned off the wire the whole house oh it got literally all over I think you're gonna need to call plumber after this I think I'm gonna have to kill you okay but look at it it's almost done leaking I'm gonna start breaking this wall now what if after all this there's no bigger room on the other side there is gonna be a room it was in the blueprints just like how the pipe was in the blue case oh no way is there a room I can't see any oh my god oh my god dude wait this is like bigger than my room at home I could stand in here yo oh the light works okay it's a little wet in here we're literally underneath my house well Drew I mean I think there's only one thing left to do we need to make this place look sick we're at Target and we're about to get a bunch of stuff for this room we're gonna be spending a lot of money on this so there's a lot of options for TVs but we don't know which one we're gonna go with yeah the biggest one we could find dude it has to fit in the room okay this one could fit if this is too big and it doesn't fit in the room it's your fault I'll make it fit okay Pikachu Sonic the more pillows the better we need a PS5 yeah go big or go home right we need drinks for our mini fridge and of course we have the mini fridge I think it's time to check out this better be worth it oh my God this ain't fitting he ended up calling the plumber to help fix the pipe that Drew broke it's gonna be fixed though hopefully how's it going down there pretty good we're all done oh cool so we can actually turn the water back on sure can absolutely it wasn't as bad as the time Ben caught the toilet oh my God I can't imagine that yeah we're sorry that Ben put you through that I don't even want to talk about it so let's get to finish in this room yeah let's do it so I invited all the friends over to be at the house in about two and a half hours this room needs to be complete by the time they get here also it's gonna ruin the surprise yeah that is not enough time so right now we're literally just trying to put everything that we bought at Target inside the room and decorate it like crazy this is the moment of truth I don't know if it's gonna fit oh shoot it's a bit popcorn machine coming through true why did you buy diapers we don't have a bathroom down here what is wrong with you wow how are you doing on time we have 20 minutes all right let's go hurry hurry oh all right so obviously you guys know where it is but the average person is not going to expect this the fact that it's underneath the bed too no it's crazy we kind of made like a little slide here oh yes please it's a little dangerous but honestly we didn't do too much to the smaller part of the basement it's better than a scary dark basement so this is the room that we've all been waiting for look at that yeah every time it just looks better and better we hooked up the PS5 to the flat screen TV so we can play as many video games as we want but actual working popcorn machine there you go thank you very much we even have a disco ball just in case you want to get groovy and then we have a no farting sign specifically made for Ben and Jeremy so I say while we wait for all of them to show up we play some fortnite what do you say Oh I thought that was the plan already okay yeah yeah let's do it so we ordered pizza and apparently it's here hello yeah we're under the bed can you just lift it up here we go oh cool hello how's it going good pretty good uh we're just in our secret hidden bunker right now so you want to come check it out yeah hell yeah just watch your head all right yo oh I got Kirby Pikachu I'm gonna call my manager right now and say hey I got in an accident crack open the pizza here have a slice are you sure yeah have a slice what's your name Thiago nice to meet you Thiago yeah thank you for coming down nice meeting you guys all right nice meeting you too thanks for coming and visiting of course he literally came all the way down here to bring us the pizza all right so I checked my camera and some of my friends are arriving right now to my house I'm gonna FaceTime them and basically tell them I built a hidden secret gaming room somewhere in this house the first person to actually find the gaming room wins one thousand dollars it can be anywhere in the house good luck timer starts now oh they are scrambling they're literally going crazy are they they're messing up my house Ben's checking the garage he has to be somewhere it's not even in the kitchen oh okay Ben is literally above us right now oh it has to be he's close oh he's getting close here's us oh my God you found it there's no way run me my money here's a thousand dollars oh my God piles and dreams right whoa popcorn baby should we show everyone else I mean I did win the money so yeah why not oh there they are hey guys what the hell can we go down there come on down we're all farting oh come on should I catch a four night one underground you should do it yeah and if I can come down here anytime I want to play video games I won't tell your mom uh how about no how about yeah how about now I'll call your mom right now no you won't I have her number what all right fine you can play video games whenever you want yeah but hey no farting though actually if you fart I will actually have to break through the ceiling should we get Andrew and Lexi oh yeah I forgot about that I know me too everyone's down there already hurry up guys yeah it's fine this is like all I dreams up when I was a kid this is actually like really cool yeah guys I have a special surprise we have pizza you guys be like a little more quiet I'm trying to play this game we shouldn't have showed Jeremy this room he's not gonna leave no seriously I have a very important question if I need to use the bathroom how do I do that exactly Drew had this brilliant idea where you just put a diaper on and then you go in there oh there's not a bathroom down here what are we supposed to do babies do it so exactly Ben knows what I'm saying you guys know what time it is [Music] Jeremy hasn't said a single word this whole time dude I'm actually about to win because of the Hidden gaming room all right well guys it's getting late I do have to kick all of you guys out unfortunately wow yeah I'm sorry thank you lit for visiting my room yeah except you just kicked us out since you're kicking me out I'm telling your mom I just farted find it on yeah it's actually but somehow my mom ended up finding out where is it where's watch Jeremy told me it's right here are you okay cool how are you gonna sell the house when you need to sell it that's one of the dumbest things you've ever done so it was clear we had to turn my room back to normal but we still had all the things we bought for the gaming room so there was one more thing I wanted to do the house how long have you been subscribed for three years three years this is Devin he's been a loyal subscriber who's dreaming is to have a room just like this one that's the entrance and so I wanted to give up everything we bought for the room [Laughter] I just want to say thank you for being subscribed what should everyone do right now hit the like And subscribe button exactly if this video gets 500 000 likes then we have to build a secret gaming room in Brent's mom's house okay without her knowing dude she would kill me 500 000 likes like the video just like it like it exactly mystery shot acoustic Grace and we'll see you guys next week foreign [Music]

bring it up again but everyone I know they're afraid afraid of their [Music] skin with nothing left to show we're afraid afraid of where we've been you can't let me rning you [Music] mying the myet and that's all you want it's call [Music] [Music] your you going to let me you got [Music] let go of everything let go [Music] you going to let me you got me all right hope you all enjoyed the Long awaited Dragon rework Trailer Plus the newest in the game also known as gas which most of you didn't expect would make his way into the game I didn't expect it that much either it was a surprise for me too the heated battle between the legendary dragon and the gas villon was very intense I want to see straight W's in the chat for this rework the de went absolutely crazy on this update we know it took way longer than it was originally planned but we hope that you guys still love the way Dragon reor turned out and now that I'm done with my little Yap session let's get straight into the Showcase all right so the first fruit on the Showcase is gas which is the newest fruit in the game first move I want to showcase is suffocating fumes which is a z move let's get it this move basically makes you dash in and then slash them look at the VFX on this Bo and then next up we have bur thing Vapor which is the X [Music] move let's TP the VFX on this real quick yes sir it's basically just a little explosion and then next up we have the C move which is smog demons prob one of my favorite moves right now because it have nice track in game so let's see it this what happens when you hold it and then you just let it go then you can also use in the air like this and this is what it looks like when you tap it no burst Dam damage and then we have the f move which is traveling gas so you can either fly through somebody and it does damage or you just use it as a move for traveling purposes all right and then last up we have the m1's for the untransformed version It's a mean combo boy's getting [Music] cooked and now the part most of you guys have been waiting for the transformation here we [Music] go tell me this isn't gas bro literally tell me this is not hype this model is so sick and the the VFX on it and the weapon God damn so first up let's show off these M1 [Music] There He Go next up we have the Z move which is suffocating fumes this move doesn't stun but it does take damage over time and then we have the X move here we have bursting Vapor boom that thing does big damage too all right like I said I wanted to show you guys the Z move again because it has a special effect when used with the X so first you do Z doesn't really do that much by itself and then you press X and it makes the suffocating fumes explode so right here and then next up we have the C move which is smog demons little demons right here now it has more range this time if you see this flying at you just know you getting hit cuz these also have tracking just like the untransformed version and this is the version when you tap it and then we have the f move which is traveling gas which is pretty much is a dash unless you hit somebody with it then it actually does some damage so it's a good way to engage let me know your thoughts on the gas fruit in the comments down below all right so here we have the dragon rework okay I'm going to show you guys how much destructive power this fruit actually has okay first off I'm going to start off with the Z move which is Heatwave [Music] Cannon this thing has some good range and he's gone I don't even know where he went let me show off the range a bit more and he's getting [Music] D next up we got infernal pincer which is the X move let's get to it this one is so sick all right so this is what you do you hold the x dash at him and slam him to the Ground full fours here we go let me slam it against the wall and boom take him into the air slam him down boom and again and next up we have the seam move which is scorching downfall yall thought it was op before nah this thing got upgraded all right that's going to be it for the C move next up we have draconic sword so here we go this move also has two functions one you can use it for traveling purposes [Music] just like this you fly up and then when you fly [Applause] down you get some flame effect and you speed up fly back up slow back down a little bit and then we have the second variation which is when you actually Target someone which is right here nice little high speed combo ain't nobody reacting to this here's the m1's for the Dragon [Music] all right so as you guys saw in the trailer there was a secret Little M that oo activated and that only happens when you transform without a full furry meter you enter the hybrid form not only does it make you bigger but it also makes you stronger all right look at the little flame tril I have now even my jumps are different same thing with my dashes and look at the height comparison bro bro was a [ __ ] compared to me so that's not the only thing that changed we also have enhanced version of the moves now okay let me show off the Z move now look at that giant explosion it's way bigger than before now boom that's not the only move that got changed the V effect in the X move got changed as well here we go electricity spres right here boom Mo next up we have the scorching downfall which is a c move also got upgraded can hold it longer now look how long I'm holding it compared to the other one all right and here's the m1's for the hybrid version as you can see you get a couple more hits now it's time for the moment you all have been waiting for the actual Dragon transformation who's ready let me know in the comments right now who's ready hype it up let's go here it is the new dragon reward look how massive this dragon is and look at how he's moving it is 1 million times better than the previous model all right and this is what the dragon looks like when you press J and activate your aura you gain some armor around the whole Dragon gain a helmet armor on the body on the arms tell me that's not sick all right so when I tell you guys this thing is a bit more destructive than any other fruit in the game I'm not over exaggerating because this Z move that you're about to see fully charged is going to blow your [Music] mind look at that range hold on play I didn't even show it properly so if anybody's running away from you no they're not and still all right you guys get the deal next up we have the X move which is infernal Piner here we go big damage that boy turned into a little tornado and slam him down do it one more time that's it for the X move next up we have the insane C move which is known as scorching Downfall by far the most destructive move in the entire game let's get it boom whole island is doomed there's no Escape in that move there is literally no Escape all the devs that worked on this fruit really outdid themselves One Last Time Boom and now we have the F which drags him along with you and then you can slam him down boom if you guys couldn't tell I actually dragged uzo along with me watch all right he's going with me now and we're going down boom that's just the travel move so this is what it looks like when you don't drag somebody with you hey here's the M1 for the dragon transformation and one last time all right that's going to be for the dragon showcase hope you guys enjoyed you guys seen it just now it's actually top tier yo yo yo oh hold on hold on hold on Yo wait wait a minute I'm receiving many gifts from ooth hold on hold on Yo ooth was actually going crazy with the gift look at all these dragons in my inventory so yeah there's a new gifting system in the game now if you guys want to give fruits to your friends you can do it right here using the gift system all right check out this new UI I already got most of this stuff and then let's go to the bottom we also have the new gas fruit right here but as you guys can see it moves you hover your mouse over it so at the bottom we have the new dragon fruit with the cool UI effect in the background so if you click on it right here it says transforms the dragon user into a mighty Dragon allowing them to rule over the skies with scorching Flames hold on what is that another dragon [Music] and do not fter all right so I know you guys definitely did not expect another Dragon variation to be coming out in blocks as well to let you guys know there are two versions of the Dragon one is the Eastern which is the first dragon I showed you guys and the one I'm going to show you guys right now is the Western dragon as you guys just saw in the trailer that thing is actually hype as well it has a completely different move set similar to the old Dragon but also has some other stuff as well and the model looks actually sick so let's get straight to it here we go completely different animation here's what it looks like with the armor [Music] on take it off so the armor is basically just you turning on your or and it looks way better with the armor on all right first thing I'm going to Showcase is the m1's again pretty much similar to the other Dragon here you go let's do the Z [Music] move Z move actually has insane range I'm going to Showcase it one more time [Music] [Music] and it hits as you guys can see right here 6,000 damage all right next up we have The Inferno pincer so this is the X move and here we go again boom and then we have the C move which is scorching downfall this one's actually sick here it [Music] is Yo and again and one more time like nobody in this area is actually safe everyone's getting boed away and then next up we have the f move which is Shak conic [Music] sore another slam down move pretty much here you go and then this is what it looks like when you just use the F uh without hitting somebody basically launches you forward and you get a speed boost and you can start flying and again all right that's going to be it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed the new dragon reworks surprise surprise two dragons now so that means double the fun and double the destru all right just imagine both of these dragons at once flying around and destroying the entire map the whole server is just going to be playing Dragon I can already see that happening so I do want to apologize one more time that this update has been taking so long but as you guys can see the devs have been cooking secretly in the background the second dragon was a complete surprise for all of you and I hope you guys enjoyed it so I'll see you guys in the next video peace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so he [Music] [Music]"

Call of Duty Diablo Immortal raid Shadow Legends these are just some of the hundreds of games that are run by scammers effectively trying to bankrupt you we're going to expose them for who they are three weeks ago I started playing the incredibly popular mobile game Pokemon unite it seems simple you're in one team of Pokemon and your goal is to head to the other side of the map and score goals against the other team of Pokemon it's completely free to play and over 100 million people have downloaded the game but I'd already just finished the tutorial by the time I was slapped with a full page ad to spend ten dollars on something called the unite membership no way I thought so I closed that Tab and carried on playing not realizing at this point that this was all part of a bigger plan to rinse me of everything that I own it took just six more minutes of play time before I was greeted with this see the game gives you a login bonus every single day that you come back to the game and play but this pass eventually gives you bonuses on top of that bonus which actually seemed pretty reasonable for the 60 EOS gems that it cost me which equates to about one dollars in real money so I bought it one of the first times I've ever spent money on a free game and I felt alive kind of like how you feel when you manage to NAB one of those Amazon Lightning Deals just before they run out after the first couple of days though I started to notice that while I was getting plenty of new stuff and constant level ups and I had been given four different Pokemon to play with I started losing like a lot I started to realize that this game was less about skill on the battlefield the combat is effectively just mashing your different attacks as soon as they become ready to use it's more about how strong you make your Pokemon before you step foot on the battlefield so I decided that I needed some held items held items are what you equip to your Pokemon to give them improved stats so I headed to the shop and I spent about half of the total in-game EOS coins I'd earned so far buying three items one that increases my maximum health one that gives me Health regeneration and one that increases my damage output and I thought finally my Pokemon is kitted out I don't have to think about this anymore I can just play the game so I charged into battle with my head held high and I got absolutely demolished it became very clear to me at this point that it wasn't just enough to buy the held items because when you first get one they're almost completely useless like this attack increasing scope lens that I bought it was literally giving me a 0.4 extra chance of getting a critical hit that dealt more damage imagine adding 0.4 to your dinner one evening you'd get one extra p in order to become competitive in ranked matches you actually need to level your items up all the way to grade 30. at which point they will give you a big game changing buff like let's say 15 more damage but the problem is leveling up your items is a ridiculous process you can't earn levels with skillful play you have to buy them with something called item enhancers but then these item enhancers are so unbelievably slow to earn through any organic means that I was practically forced to make my second purchase the battle pass this game and almost every other mobile game like it uses battle passes as a way to Guild their players into paying more money every time you complete a game it'll tell you the rewards you earned and then the rewards that you could have earned on top of that if only you bought the battle pass which is just this whole extra stream of rewards to keep playing and keep coming back to the game and in this case a lot of those rewards just so happened to be what I was looking for item enhancers this was ten dollars in real money I bought it because the alternative option was to sign away weeks of my life grinding for it but I was becoming very aware at this point that I'd already spent more on this game than I had in any mobile game I've ever played before still at least now when I was playing I could guarantee myself a steady supply of new item enhancers so I could remain a competitive battler and that's about where you'd expect the story to end right wrong because right when I thought that I just paid my way out of my problems is actually when things took the biggest dive so far because it's at this point that I realized just how many of these item enhancers I was going to need see why when you're upgrading your items all you can see is how many item enhancers it cost to go from the level you're on to the next level and so when I saw that all of my level one items just needed three item enhancers to level up and then I saw that with this battle pass I could get myself a bundle of 30 item enhancers every few days of playing I thought that this 10 would easily cover me thank you but what the game didn't tell me was that every single level you go up with your held items the more item enhancers you need to get to the one after that so that actually to get my three held items to level 30 it wasn't that I needed 100 or 200 of them I actually needed no less than 7761. when I realized this my jaw practically Hit the Floor to put that number into some perspective in the entire base game of Pokemon unite the maximum amount of item enhancers you can possibly earn without getting into the whole loot box opening system is 1535. if I completely maxed out my battle pass which is already something that I've paid for on top of that I could bag myself an extra 360 but I mean no Not only would this process take me roughly 150 days of playing every single day to earn but even with that I would still need to find a way to get the remaining 5866 item enhancers that I still needed and that's when you have almost no option but to turn to the shop how much do you think this was going to cost me a simple almost required mobile game in-app purchase 100 100 real money dollars and if you wanted to max out all of your items not just the three that you currently have equipped 760 dollars or Pikachu for that price but the scary part of it is that at this point choice that I have I poured so much time and love into my account but I didn't feel like it was an option to just stop playing it was either I pay a hundred dollars or I accept that I will be disproportionately disadvantaged in every future game that I ever want to play I decided to go for it which I know is probably the single most pointless purchase I've made in my entire life and I have made a lot of pointless purchases over the years but I wanted to give you guys a real experience I wanted to know and to be able to show you what would happen next and sure enough somehow it managed to get even worse because then only at this point only a hundred dollars into the supposedly free mobile game did I find out how Pokemon unite makes its big money so we've established at this point that EOS gems are the premium currency that you can use to buy almost anything in the game but it's not the only currency because you also have EOS coins which combine most of the things that gems cam but you need a lot to them next we have tickets which come in three flavors EOS tickets fashion tickets and Holo tickets fashion and Holo tickets unlock new skins for your trainer and Pokemon of choice or else tickets let you buy those item enhancers as well as boost cards that increase the amount of experience points you earn tickets like coins can be earned in events and challenges when those run dry you do need to buy them with gems are you keeping up because then on top of that you have AOS energy which is required if you want to play a match and get the proper set of rewards but is gradually used up every time you do so and we've even now got the limited time cake currency for the ongoing anniversary cake Challenge on top of that if you haven't already guessed after two weeks of playing this game my head was spinning the game is so unbelievably confusing to the point of being stressful and I was about to find out that it is intentionally designed that way not to mention that I worked out if I actually wanted to continue to play the game competitively with full access to all the characters I wanted to use with a nice selection of outfits for them and enough energy that I would continue to get rewards for doing so this game was going to cost me at the very least another twelve hundred dollars over the next six months so I put the game down I grabbed my laptop and I started digging and this is where I understood just how much I was being and was about to be manipulated and how widespread these developers who are effectively scammers have actually become so it all starts with the first spend and this isn't a term that I've invented this is a term that's actually being used by developers this is Taurus jernstrom CEO of the mobile game company tribe flame giving a talk on monetization strategies for mobile games the first spin it breaks the eyes then they think of themselves as Spenders in the game it's okay for me to spend me in the game what is teaching these other developers is that 98 of players when they first start playing a free mobile game will go into it under the premise that they won't be making any in-app purchases I was one of them most likely you're one of them too but the second that these games can get you to lay down your first dollar they've effectively broken your barrier I mean your willingness to then make further payments will Skyrocket so you need to break the wall first in hindsight this must be why Pokemon unite gave me that super cheap login bonus just six minutes after I started playing they don't care about a dollar they just wanted to crack me to turn me from a free player into a spender and I only realize this after watching this developer talk about it but the way that the game manipulated me into buying it was through the anchoring technique by first presenting me with an expensive in-app purchase that they actually knew that I wouldn't buy that unite membership they set my expectations that ten dollars is about what a set of prizes is worth in this game which meant that when they then swooped in with that one dollar deal to get the login bonus pass I would have felt foolish for turning it down because of the comparative value I got played but I've realized that the reason I cared so much about this purchase and the reason that so many people pour so much cash into these games is based on another simple human facet that's being exploited we like to be better than our peers it's baked into our very DNA that our survival depends on having a competitive Advantage versus the people around us and so pit wealthy players against each other at something allow each of them to be able to pay for that competitive advantage and the only party that really wins is the game developer who's charging them you can see this technique in all the most popular games like just recently Diablo Immortal where you will get a completely sliced apart by the players who have spent big money who are called whales in the industry mind you that's the gambling industry we're talking about says something about this if you're trying to be a free player in Diablo model you're effectively a side character to these whales and your best chance of winning is just to stick by their side and to support them and this is by design it gives that two percent of the player base who is willing to spend thousands of dollars that Power Trip feeling that keeps them coming back to spend even more and sadly even if you'll never beat one of these whale players you're still unknowingly fueling the system being able to tear you apart with ease it makes you the thrill that the whales keep paying for and this is where I really start to hate this if it was as simple as you pay a load of money and then you just win from now on that would be too kind that would mean that the devs would miss out on making any further money from the whales so they found a way around that too what these games do now is when you pay to make yourself significantly stronger they'll let you have your first few satisfying wins with noticeably weaker players to stimulate that reward mechanism and for you to associate that purchase with a positive feeling but once that's over we'll soon stop hitting you against other players who've also spent large sums of money in the game thus always creating this feeling that no matter how much you've already paid you're always one purchase away from being content from being better than your peers but never actually getting there because there will always be people willing to spend even more than you this is why I felt like no matter how much I was spending in Pokemon unite I still kept losing and I mean Diablo emote tour is even worse you know how like it's quite a big deal to pay ten dollars for an in-game purchase you know how like I absolutely appalled that you had to spend a thousand in Pokemon unite well in this game it can cost you 100 000 to max out your character a hundred thousand dollars to actually escape this feeling of constantly just needing a little bit more power and that's just until they release an update that increases that cap so I've made my first purchase I'm already feeling the social pressure of wanting to be better than other people that's just step one of the hook habit hobby model that's starting to become the playbook for a top grossing game because to make the real money off me they also have to make sure that their game becomes it and according to this guy the best way to do that is to give me rapid progression to start with to make sure that the first few levels are incredibly quick the first few unlocks are incredibly cheap and the first two enemies incredibly easy this stimulates the reward centers in players brains the same reward centers that give you a rush every time you pass an exam at school or every time you get a pay rise at work and it does it in such a way that your brain will start to Crave it that you'll want to play these games as a regular part of your day because the progression you're getting gives you more instant gratification than probably any other part of your life will and this is why you barely can find a game now that doesn't have a battle pass baked inside of it it's less about the ten dollars it might cost you per season it's more about trying to form a habit inside of you at the point where you've paved real cash to get extra rewards every day who's going to not log in and claim them and at the point where they do that why not just play a couple of games too now it makes sense why Pokemon unite was so Keen to get me to buy the battle pass because as soon as I did it makes the most efficient way to play the game from now on to log in a minimum of once per day some games like Diablo they go even further with this offering login bonuses that start tiny but get bigger and bigger over time so long as you log in every day to the point where you'll actually be scared to miss a day because you'll lose so much progress on this bonus ladder but it's the hobby part of hook habit hobby that's the most dangerous because once that habit is formed and you've already spent vast amounts of time and money progressing your character this is kind of like where I am with Pokemon unite right now these companies know you're not going anywhere they have your complete undivided attention and that's when they start to change the way that they carry on earning from you away from traditional power ups because you've already spent hundreds or thousands making your character stronger and more on convenience I find this so horrible but effectively by slowing down your natural progression with the sole purpose of trying to sell you ways to speed it up again like experience Point multiplies making it so that I don't have to pay to get that same high stimulation fast progression feeling that I used to get when I first started playing the game for free not a dissimilar strategy to drug dealers I should point out who effectively build their businesses by handing out freebies to get clients addicted with the hope that they then become dependent and are willing to pay to keep that high going it sounds stupid but at this point in the player Journey most will pay real money to earn even let's just say a bonus 10 experience points and it's all driven by something called the Ikea effect I should elaborate see it's a pretty well regarded fact that Ikea furniture is not the best quality but because it comes in pieces and you have to assemble it yourself that effort that you've put in makes you value it so much more and in the exact same way developers know that even if you realize that their game is not the most balanced consumer friendly Fair service out there once you spent weeks building up your character and putting in the work to make them right for you your attachment is so high that you'll be willing to go to Great Lengths to keep the fun alive but then we've got the question of value we've established at this point why someone might want to make an in-game purchase but what is it that's moving that needle that's pushing them to want to spend extortionate amounts of money well in a large part it's because they don't realize how much they're spending thanks to a tactic known as material Distortion the idea of creating a layer between the in-game money that you're spending and the real world value of what that's costing you and I realized my God this is so real like when I wanted to upgrade my items in Pokemon I had to First buy item enhancers to do that but then it's not like I could just pay dollars to buy those item enhancers I had to use EOS tickets and then when I wanted to buy EOS tickets I had to use EOS Gems or to put it another way I had to convert my currency three times to be able to actually do what I wanted with it borderline criminal because not only has it started to feel like it's not real money being spent but I've all idea how much each purchase is actually worth anymore not to mention the fact that you can almost never purchase the exact amount of gems you need meaning that a you spend more than you need to and B you will always have leftover gems in your wallet that can't be exchanged back for cash which is just going to encourage you to make your next purchase by topping up just a bit more and the cherry on top of this whole alternate cash reality is that if you look at them closer you realize that this game doesn't have a single mention of the word purchase they never use the word loot boxes they're prize boxes they never use the word buy it's always obtain they don't even use the word shop it's an Emporium here it genuinely reminds me of those killer clowns that you used to see on the internet they have the most child appealing innocent facade but just beneath that thin veil they're pure evil imagine if there was like a High Street shop that tried to pull the stunt that made you exchange or cash into tokens as you walked in that could only be spent in that shop they wouldn't get away with it neither should these guys oh yeah and if we say that material Distortion makes you pay two to three times what you otherwise would have for in-game items then reward randomization which all of these top games are now using was going to bring that all the way up to 10 times this is Call of Duty mobile it's actually one of my favorite mobile games from a gameplay perspective but check this out a lot of the rarest and the most desirable items in the game are locked behind loot boxes like for example I really really want this gun they've got in the middle it's designed so that when it kills people it turns them into a shadow that will win me so much Social validation and it costs 30 premium coins to have a spin it's about 50 cents in value so I head on to the store I buy myself 420 coins that should be enough to have 14 runs of this I'll definitely get that gun but then I lose the first one and I realize huh the price just went up and it's going to keep going up every single time I attempted from 30 to 40 to 120 to 300 and Beyond it's making me feel like I'm so close to getting it every single time like the pointer will literally sit above and then just slip past the gun I really want it will also hit one by one put a received marker over everything I have unlocked so far reminding me of how far I've come and encouraging me to finish it and get everything that the loot box could possibly contain it's only when I check the hidden stats that I realized this is not a roulette wheel like it appears each item does not have the same chance of coming up but in actuality the real chance of getting this gun it starts at literally 0.08 percent and it goes up by just 0.01 each time until you've received every other item in the Box 0.08 percent that is that is disgusting you will you will almost definitely pay at least 100 for this gun that is multiple times more than almost any player would have even considered had it just been priced like a normal product in a shop so all of this explains how these games are able to make frankly extortionate amounts of spending seem reasonable the only thing left is how they create the sense of urgency for those purchases and the way they do this is simply by overloading the player you remember how Pokemon unite has no less than seven different currencies and how I was completely and utterly overwhelmed by all the Interlocking Systems that came as a result of them none of those needed to exist you could have had the exact same game where everything was bought and sold with just the simple EOS coins the only reason that we had to have seven currencies is to create multiple separate in-game economies in which you don't just have to be rich in one of them but all of them to actually succeed and it's a system that you can't actually beat because the more resources that you spend on one currency the more you find that another one becomes your bottleneck most games do this through energy Pokemon unite has it and to be honest the game raid Shadow Legend system is even more egregious where every single time you choose to play you're spending not just your time but also this virtual energy currency which you can either wait for stupid amounts of time to recharge on its own or pay to refill your tank so just to be very clear you have to not just pay to buy your items and level up your character and get your costumes but also to play the game that's supposed to be free and at the same time as feeling like you have to spend in every single Direction at once you're also given the feeling that you have to do so quickly no joke ninety percent of purchases you'll be showing in these games they're all somehow just about to expire you see timers everywhere always counting down there's no reason why this Pokemon costume should need to expire it's not like the Pokemon company is going to run out of virtual materials to make them it's literally just to instill you with a sense of fear that if you look away if you so much just put the game down for too long you might just miss your dream item forever and what I've realized is the worst part of how this game stresses you out on purpose is the way that it handles the Pokemon themselves you unlock access to cool new Pokemon just by playing which is great you even get rare and fancy outfits for them but they're temporary unless you pay to keep them the game takes the stuff it's given to you away from you and this Taps into the very fundamental loss of version that all humans have we are biologically coded to disproportionately Value something that we own such that the idea of losing it would cause us more pain than the happiness we would get from obtaining it if we didn't have it and these gaming companies are now using this to replace just having a shop that you can casually browse at your own Leisure for instead allowing you to feel like the thing is yours first and then charging you to not snatch it away from you the long and short of it what I realized from three weeks of playing one of these games as well as digging into why these companies are doing what they're doing is that the more addicted you become to the game the more profitable the company is going to be the success in this industry is no longer defined by review scores or player satisfaction it's defined by how effectively a developer is able to convert an innocent player who just wants to enjoy what they think is a free game into someone who possesses all the traits of a severe gambling addiction I wish I could be the bearer of good news but the truth of it is these Shady practices are getting more and more sophisticated as time goes on they're starting to spread from mobile games to console games and we've even just started seeing the effects that it's having on the next generation of players spawning all sorts of impulse control disorders so be aware of games that try to milk you for your money and feel free to subscribe to the channel and share this video if you found it useful but if you do find yourself in one of these games and you feel yourself about to throw your phone at a wall in frustration I've got the perfect product for you this is Rhino Shield's brand new grip which once attached to the back of your phone case prevents it from ever flying out of your hands they weren't kidding when they called it grip but that's not actually my favorite part of this see grip is not just about peace of mind using your phone out and about and not breaking your face when scrolling at night it's also a kickstand and for once it's a kickstand that doesn't feel like it's about to tip over if I so much as blow on it it's really solid and also just as customizable as Ryan Shields cases you can design your grip pretty much however you want there are two sizes grip mini and grip mags and this grip Max is also available in a magsafe version which works perfectly with the new Rhino shield magsafe places the cherry on top is that grip is also made from 85 recycled materials hit the link in the description if you want to get yours and use the code Mr grip for 20 off in the first week

games have come a really long way in the last 50 years I'm bored so I spend way too much money buying different consoles and renting out spaces that represent different decades so I could have a little bit of fun today why don't we start in 1983 Atari sales are at an all-time high the Ford F-150 looked like this and the average house cost 68 700 somebody give me a time machine still a lot of money this does kind of feel like I'm entering this room from the future though obviously I wasn't born yet at this time but this this is a huge milestone in humanity it's really funny because the commercials seem to be appealing to adults probably because kids didn't have a culture of playing video games yet they just had a culture of playing outside also kids don't have money let's play I started setting up the console and a few things that I realized is one it's not that different from the ones we have today a few plugs go into a wall it comes with a controller and you connect it to your TV but the Atari is cool because the game just starts as soon as you turn it on the controllers are very simple you move this around and move up and down you gotta hit this little ping pong ball oh that was a DOT I facetimed my dad to ask him what his high score on pong was he said 21-0 a perfect game so 21 21-0 I'm gonna try to beat your I'm gonna try to beat your score all right good luck I love you it took me a while to get a hang of this game every time I lost a point I would just reset it with this analog button that's kind of nice it's so fun to experience a video game that my dad grew up with you're done you're done you're done I can see how this would be really fun if you had no exposure to modern technology whatsoever [Music] I did not get even close to beating my dad's high score when he was eight if I think about it for a second that's kind of sick I don't exactly know how to process the fact that I I can't even beat a 50 year old game but I don't really care because I can just time travel to the next decade that's right the 90s an Italian plumber is king of the world and the Nintendo 64 becomes one of the first consoles to jump from 2D to 3D Graphics AO F-150 update houses cost more money now this is a shock to me the N64 is the first console that I ever played growing up so this is going to be really nostalgic welcome to the 1990s this is a Nintendo 64. the biggest changes the gameplay we'll get to that but I would say one of the other big changes the control the controller but this game right here folks the first three-dimensional gameplay experience so I got this console from one of my friends named Tron who works at a coffee shop so I think we've got a new Challenger to defeat I'm going to set it up ugh guys this is so emotional I'm serious I have so many good memories playing this console at my grandma's house those were the good old days now my first time playing in like 15 years I've got to beat a dude named Tron who tron's high scores are pretty much listed on each level I'm just gonna try to be one I mean let's be honest guys the Atari looks so bad in comparison to this I can even record this game with a capture card that's how far we've come I'm jumping I'm running I'm throwing things all in a three-dimensional space to be this level I ran past some balls like this is gaming next I got shot out of a cannon on purpose the fact that there are animations is really crazy but what's really crazy is how scared I got when I realized I've gotta beat Baba bomb it was actually really easy I did it like 30 seconds however I didn't even get close to tron's high score I didn't beat tron's high score he has no life apparently anyways the 90s was so much fun but I'll see you guys in the next millennium 2000s yay I'm alive now the early 2000s brought us really good computers a new F-150 and more expensive houses how does this keep happening anyways let's hang out in 2007 for a minute we made it to the 2000s welcome to the internet to Mouse for a computer I could think of a hundred games that were amazing in the 2000s Grand Theft Auto Halo Call of Duty Guitar Hero but my 2000s gaming experience was marked by one particular game Bruins game an open world multiplayer computer game I remember coming home from school one day my brother playing on the family computer clicking repeatedly on a pixelated tree all to increase his wood cutting level and I begged him to let me play so my first day playing a computer game ever looked like this I chopped six logs collect four pieces of cowhide get called a noob by a random player and dance by some goblins keep in mind this game predates Minecraft so that just goes to show you that the human desire to chop down trees exploit cows and dance with medieval creatures it you can't escape it that entire process my first day on RuneScape when I was nine took me three and a half hours I'm gonna try to do it in three and a half minutes all right my time begins now I spawned in I made a new account my username is Brad Ward I'm gonna run over to these trees this game is so fun it's just such a different gaming experience than Atari Super Mario and frankly I was hooked one more one more boom okay we have six logs I'm gonna run to the cows whenever I first played this game I didn't know how to move that's why it took me so long to do everything here are the cows Peta if you're watching this please look away [Music] hmm [Music] okay I've got all the cowhide I need I need someone to call me a noob now thank you I'm out of here goblins goblins goblins here we go boom I'm dancing with the goblins so nostalgic that only took me 27 minutes rad War do you have anything to say for yourself please subscribe to Ryan Trey oh thank you Brad that's awfully night that's that he brought he said to himself we don't have free will that's enough Brad Ward all right it is time for the Wii new F-150 houses cost more money you get the gist I have a Wii I'm also in a house from Fixer-Upper because that's like the Pinnacle of the 2010s I really wanted to come here I love makeovers now we've obviously come a long way since the Nintendo 64. we no longer use cartridges we use discs now that's what that's what we use get used to it until it changes but the Wii is so Innovative because it's the first control that you can actually move and it responds to the game that I'm gonna be playing Wii Sports let's turn this thing on now it's extremely important that if you play Wii Sports you have The Wristband right I vividly remember playing Wii Sports and always getting my butt kicked by Matt I'm an adult now I'm gonna beat him for the first time in my life I've got a game loaded up against Matt let's rock and roll there it is just lost the first game to make my attempt at beating my childhood bully Matt even harder I'm going to attempt to beat him while telling you about Shopify Shopify is the best place to start grow and manage a business no shot no shot Matt he's diving everywhere there it is Shopify lets you sell online in person and on all the big social medias I started a little clothing store called howdy a year ago with Shopify and it's

let's go to the Future all right here we go technology is more advanced than we could have dreamed of massive companies are racing to make the world more virtual F-150 is looking good houses looking unaffordable and I'm sure in a few years this headset is going to look outdated but for now it's the most futuristic thing I am my friends welcome to the future I mean A lot's happened since the last console Grand Theft Auto 5 became the biggest game ever PlayStations 4 and 5 came out a bunch of Xboxes no one really knows the name of those Nintendo switch and how we live in an era where for 400 you can go wherever you want a round-trip ticket to Ohio costs more than that I'm gonna go into the metaverse I meet up with an old friend if you don't know I spent 100 metaverse days in this headset last year and attempted to become more popular there than Mark Zuckerberg in the process though I made a true friend named clay who I actually ended up meeting in real life and it feels like a good time to meet up again [Music] clay somebody no way dude you are back I'm back big dog of course dude I can't believe this is real I'm sitting down hold on does that feel better there you go yeah dude no way like me that is crazy how are you I'm good how are you good man long time no see I know oh you gotta give me a hug dude come on just like old times clay and I just hung out we tried cooking we went to a 7-Eleven got some fun drinks we boxed each other and eventually we found a world with a ping pong table [Music] [Music] thank you

🎥 A gamer girl named Olivia struggles with her self-image and the pressure of being perfect, as she navigates high school where she hides her face behind a mask. Throughout the story, she encounters bullies and faces the challenge of being a beauty influencer. With help from new friends, Olivia learns to embrace her true self and breaks free from the facade of perfection enforced by her father's expectations, ultimately choosing to be herself rather than conform to societal standards.

Well, I've leveled up since then and decided to build a hidden gaming room in a school! This would’ve been a dream come true for my younger self. What kid wouldn’t want a hidden gaming room to escape to in the middle of class. This turned out incredible and I can’t wait for you to see it!

impossible to find I've challenged the teachers to find us by the end of the school day and if they do I've agreed to give away $5,000 we only have 60 seconds till school starts we need to get to hiding I'm going to become a janitor good morning Cal Bulldog we have been challenged by a YouTuber who is currently hiding in our building all students and staff be on alert the teachers are never going to find us in here this is actually crazy I hope we don't get detention for this come on no let's go it's happy good morning class how are you guys today good Matthew thinks that only the teachers are going to be looking for help and in order to get your help I will give everyone in here an a I'm on Matthew team you are failing so this is actually an abandoned classroom it looks like it hasn't been used in years we have to be very quiet while we're in here cuz school is in session right now guys what the hand sanitizer still works we're going to find it Matthew we have everybody on guard looking and we'll find I'm going to hide by myself because those guys always get caught they went in that classroom let's go I could totally build a secret room in this cafeteria but it's kind of spooky I don't really know if I want to so I'm going to shut this Cheyenne was rushing to find where to build her hidden room and Uncle Dave was hiding in plain sight when I went to school uh I uh yeah and he was even the first one to have an encounter with a teacher oh is this that hidden room thing I I it's a it's a documentary documentary yeah just a docu think she bought it that was a close call we have got to find this guy we know he's around this school somewhere we are the sharpest people here ready go all no not in there no nobody up there all right we're going to start off by cleaning everything up in here while the teachers are looking for us we'll be turning this classroom into a space them gaming room hey guys would it be a bad time to tell you that I didn't bring anything in my backpack that means we have no tools or any equipment to transform this into a gaming room we're going to have to leave the safety of our secret room and go back out in the Halls to get our stuff no that means the teacher could catch us what are you guys doing oh nothing come on come on come on we going to go that way very quickly in Cas he's let's go y y did we check your refrigerator no no iise a very clean refrigerator Miss oh my goodness okay so he has to be somewhere go go go we made it back to the room the bad news is we're going to have to keep going out there if we actually want to trans form this into a gaming room where did you get this thing I may have stole it from the Janitor's Closet it's time to make this room look a lot better I love editing now that we have everything painted it looks much better in let's go come on hurry going to catch this guy he's got to be around here at the end of every class the teachers are grouping up to search the entire school to look for us we need to be very careful when we choose to leave the room where would you hide if you were the master of hiding in plain sight I'm going to find you everyone in this school is looking for us while me and the boys were surrounded by teachers my sister had a mass cheat C I have a super secret Advantage here my cousin is actually the librarian can you please do me a huge favor and not tell any of the teachers or anyone that I'm in here don't worry cheyen your secret is safe with me I will not tell anybody but I do have students coming in in about an hour and it is the library so you're going to have to be a little bit quiet I can do that all right I got to go I don't have a lot of time before the next class starts so I really have to go get my materials quick he's not in there Janitor's Closet the janitor closet I've seen his videos before these look suspicious I didn't hear him in there our loud I would have thought for sure he'd be in the teacher Lounge I mean it this is just one of many disguises for Uncle Dave you want some help no looks like it's time for Uncle Dave to be the gym teacher the students are waiting for gym class all they need is a coach one handed watch on this back wall we're going to build custom cabinets with giant TVs inside of them this wall is so heavy we still have to add our vinyl wrap over it with outer space on it let's install these the coolest part about these walls is we actually put a ton of LED lights behind them so they glow we have to vinyl wrap the other side over there and I just realized we left it in our car outside we're on a mission I know I'm a newer teacher here but I feel like I know all the hiding spots there's not that many around [Music] here I would know if something was out of place yeah I don't see anything going to start off by building a fake room right here and then putting a water fountain on it so I never get caught and I can make a ton of noise since the librarian is on my side can you please help me lift this wood frame one in place now it's time for us to put the second support up I thought this was supposed to be a secret room okay we we have to give it some time it'll look a lot better I'll like put drywall sheets on here and then I'm going to have a water fountain okay you have 40 minutes we got to get outside of the school immediately okay we got it we had to risk getting caught just for this let's go back inside I'm holding the last piece of our space puzzle this room's looking so much better and the best part no one knows we're in here nothing there okay shy and I know the perfect room that has items to camouflage your secret room but we're going to have to leave the library I look ridiculous room with all the stuff is right here and I have the keys look at this there's a water fountain I can do like a hand like it will open up like a door this is going to work perfect you are the best secret weapon ever what's up ready I'm going to blend in as your new PE coat I'm going to blend in you're not supposed to say that part oh I'm not supposed to say that the substitute yeah oh stop throwing them balls so normally we running gym class but today we're just going to walk we're going to think about our future and how great it's going to be how long have you been a coach I've been a coach for a minute these kids are going to blow my cover every secret room needs security cameras so you can monitor what's going on in the outside and lucky for us this school is filled with cameras I have the blueprint layout to this entire school and I know exactly where the security camera room is are we going to get to the camera room we can't go in the hallways I have the perfect idea sorry [Music] teachers this is going to be the perfect secret room but I need to cover this immediately before a teacher finds it all the walls are going to be pink to match my overall and I'm going to put little pink disco balls hanging from the meanwhile Uncle Dave was struggling as the gym teacher we got to get out of here no nothing there B's moving nothing there's nothing back here I put a have you guys seen Matthew Bean no are you sure these walls are so thin I can hear the teacher talking to the students he's not over there check this door and up blocked all right I keep hearing people talking in the hallway if I pull some books a hidden door would open I don't think they're ever going to find us not worth a try we're actually going to go through the ceiling so we don't get caught yeah hurry it up feel like I'm Inus look's like we got to go that way a little bit and we'll get to the security camera room you know I normally fart when I'm nervous and I'm nervous right now going down down P me luck we got to go down there lock the door quick as possible so nobody gets in the room coolest camera guy on the planet we have access to all of the security cameras in here there's the cafeteria the hallways we're going to rewire all of these cameras through the ceiling up there into our room you can see they're looking for us right now we got keys to every room so we can definitely check to see if there's someone outside the door they're obviously looking for us we need to get out of this room as quick as possible we turned off all of their monitors and unplugged the camera em good luck finding us now teachers I'm rerouting this ethernet cable if I make one mistake I'm going to go right through the ceiling now for my next gig I'm in the cafeteria I'm going to disguise as a lunch lady and blend right in I don't need no stupid hidden room oh my God look at all those kids step right up we got the a really healthy portion of peas oops here's your milk you like some fruit with the with your peas that would be great it's mystery meat yeah look it's going to be great where's your lunch card I don't have it we take Paypal Google pay I'm throw the spoon in oh thank these are trash they probably are but you're going to eat them now I just have to figure out how to attach this I happen to have this I did it this looks so good time to make this room look super pretty I need to get these walls painted super fast cuz students are going to be in here any second I wonder how Matthew is doing right now we're about to add two giant cabinets right there with TVs in them so we can play video games and have access to all the security cameras so we never get caught by the teachers whose idea wasn't to make these so heavy uh [Music] yours perfect these are actually TVs inside of these cabinets we have these wooden frames right here that we custom made that we're going to put around the TVs so it looks like they're windows in the spaceship now that everything's connected let's see if the space windows work is is going on still right right right my B it looks so real I could taste it the door's locked the kids are coming the kids are knocking I can't wait anymore open oh this is just new construction here my cousin is the best there's an entire class in here right now and I'm really scared cuz I keep touching the water F all right cheyen everybody is gone but the teachers are getting very suspicious I'm so nervous I helped Cheyenne as much as I could but I got to get back to my library duties how do you like the food so far it's actually good no this is terrible this is terrible I know you don't want no peas but we got to use them up you know the rules I don't want peas feel like I'm going to throw up L it's over I'm out I should just be hiding with Matthew this is too much work these kids are ruthless this is the wiring for the security cameras once I figure it out we'll be able to see everything that's going on in the school we literally have access to every single security camera in this entire school she's right outside our lockers now we can monitor everything going on in the school without leaving our room we've got to find him he's got to be here you go down there and start a little bit I'll start here all right s about somewhere I don't know how I'm going I get this in my room because there is teachers in classes everywhere okay I made it to the library I don't think anyone saw me so I have to get all my decorations into this room see I would know if something was out of place okay someone's coming I have to go let's see here see now this room seems a little different something feels off I don't see anything no one of the most important things in a hidden room is the snacks and I want a place to hide them so so we're going to cut a massive hole in the wall right there and cover it with this bulldog logo cuz that's the school's mascot you're holding it the wrong way oh we custom made this sign right here since there since their school Mas since their school mascots the let's just hang this thing on the wall time to put our snacks in our hidden things this look like a normal painting right here but there's actually a huge secret it's a hidden room for snacks this room's actually starting to look incredible but notice how I didn't say gaming room and that's because we still have a lot of stuff to add it here PS5 LED lighting Games movies snacks all right that's a lot how are we going to power all this that's actually where today's sponsor comes in anor's new Prime lineup and I actually conveniently plac them inside of your backpack thanks unfortunately we couldn't fit everything that we need to make this a gaming room inside of this backpack so we're going to have to leave the comfort of our hidden room again but how are we going to do that without getting caught there's tons of teachers in the hallway we're not going back in the Halls anymore bro the principal is not going to be happy this leads straight to the outside that means we don't have to go in the hallways any it also means our hidden room isn't hidden anymore I didn't think about that anchor Prime is Anchor's most advanced Multi-Device fast charging lineup whoo the hammer anchor has everything from charging stations to power Banks whether you're at home or hiding from teachers like me Anor has you covered we just put a massive hole in the school Banner the worst part about this is the football field is right there hopefully the coach doesn't see us we disguise this hole immediately since the football field is right there we can put a hot dog machine here as a concession stand that actually opens up into our hidden room if you're on the Move hiding from teachers like us the fusion power bank's got your B the football coaches are right there it can be both used as a power bank and charger and offers massive capability with 65 wat output with two USBC ports it's perfect for keeping all of your devices powered up no matter where you are there's only one problem with this disguise it looks brand new so we're going to get some stuff to actually disguise it to make it look real my favorite device is the 250 W charging station you can charge everything from your gaming laptop to your phone in record time no more slow charging or not having enough ports it features an LCD display for real time charging updates and smart power control for managing more details and charging priorities now we officially have a new secret entrance into our hidden gaming room last one end a rotten wiener don't miss out on upgrading your setup with Anker Prime click the link in the description to get yours today thanks anchor for powering this epic build I'm hiding in the teachers Lance right now and now it's time to be a teacher yeah I don't know whose jacket this is but I'm wearing it time to go to class holy cow it's Uncle Dave it is not Uncle Dave I'm The Substitute Teacher I have a ruler that officially makes me a teacher you're not our teacher know who you are how about I teach you about among us this is my favorite student right here he he's quiet and he's behaving okay that Bel just rangu which means the class is over so this is my time to run out there right now and get some books okay I have to go really quick there are a bunch of kids in the hallway so I have to run to the Bookshelf we have a puppy book okay I need to go now maybe we should have grabbed a few more because these are really tiny and I'm going to be in here a long time but I'm not going back out there that was such a close call this side of the Hidden room is looking amazing with the Space theme however this wall over here is extremely Bland and boring so it's time to change that we're going to put two giant LED panels right there with a massive TV in the middle so we can play video games so you guys ready for your pop quiz what's 10 plus 7 21 we have a winner what's the meaning of life YouTube YouTube the room I have a sub oh uh who are you I'm the sub no sub comes with their own camera man okay time for lunch let's go I'm off to the store to get my supplies this would be so sick for our room I've got this giant controller I'm going to need this giant TV as well I have everything I need to make this game room epic so let's get back to the guys hopefully they haven't been caught yet I'm going to find you are you in here there's no water going to it maybe it's cuz the construction they are still working on this stuff sorry Cheyenne you failed this assignment come on out you assignment are in this hidden room into a hidden gaming room I don't think the TV is going to fit in this hole so that means we're going to have to actually take this through the hallway back through our locker how are we going to do that without getting caught we have any orange construction vests this is the perfect disguise I'm posing as a construction worker hopefully they'll let me in with this TV hi I'm a construction worker here to install this TV okay yeah come in the right door did that actually just work they really just let me in here because I have a TV go go go CL oh you're crazy I can't believe that work we made it thanks to Aaron secret mission we have a TV let's install it now we can play the PS5 we have the PS5 all set up and we're inside of a open it up shh there's someone right outside of our locker again in the last hour we've had so much more activity by our lockers I think the teachers are starting to get close to where we are if a teacher comes in here you'll defend me right yeah right now we're filling the entire ceiling with stars these are actually LED strips that glow and I'm cutting them to look exactly like stars so when we turn off the lights it's going to look just like outer spacing again all Elementary please evacuate the building at your primary exit I have a sneaking suspicion this is their way of tricking me to leave they trying to catch me or is this school on fire actually leaving the building Elementary is clear looks like everybody's coming back into the school right now so I think we're good I'm really glad we didn't go out everybody got we've checked classrooms we've checked the library the office we've literally checked everywhere he can't be anywhere else this is actually my favorite part of the entire room it's a custommade light that looks like the Sun so when we put it up there it'll light up the entire room this is so cool now it's time for the most important Planet because this is the only planet my girlfriend is on now that we have all of our planets in place it's time for our official LED light show 3 2 1 Thro let's go that looks so good dude it's awesome I feel like I'm under the stars in real life we didn't hide this snack cabinet from Aaron so we're out of snacks now we also have these super sick TV screens that make it look like we're inside of space or we can change them to security cameras to spy on teachers what if he's hiding in the locker those are new just had to turn off the lights someone's using the locker right now so open it up bro if we get caught right now this would be so bad we have a security camera watching our lockers right here so I can make sure that I see if the teachers are actually coming I'm one of the newest teachers here we're so lucky because we did this during summer and this school had a ton of construction so the entire School looks different so they have no idea what's new and what's on I don't know a lot about the building I'm still learning and I was told I have to find somebody school just ended which means all of the teachers are going to be going around the entire School looking for it let's go take a look and see if we can find him definitely not Hollow so he's not back there at all we are literally playing fortnite while we're hiding for teachers and as a teacher you know we got to have the superpower to be able to hear everything I hope I don't get attention sorry these guys are being so loud they're going to get us caught but I don't hear anything right now where are you Matthew I hear teachers outside the lockers we know you're here lock lockers came out the place and the principal finds US shoot look they're checking our lockers right now he opened the lockers but didn't realize we're in here bro right P again so stressed out bro this is crazy the strategy would just be to kind of look for things that are suspicious I can't tell you anything you can't tell me a single thing no can I pay you we have a new rule nobody is leaving this classroom man I got to go to the bathroom this is not a good time to go to the bathroom YouTubers where are you I'm actually starting to get really nervous the teachers keep walking by our lockers but so far we've been good everybody knows the number one rule in school is no gum but since we're in this room oh why' you bite it like that there's no rules there's no way he's hitting that well you guys can give up if you want Matthew to win no does this look weird to you no it does not did you hear something there's some students out there that know where we are but they're lying to the teachers there is there is yes yes there is someone with this Locker no one can see air I can see a space a void a light a light behind a locker that should be a wall they know where we are but they don't know how to get in what is going on they freaking out they have no clue yeah we got you this is like the greatest game room ever in a school how long have you guys been in here days this could be our new teacher Lounge Teachers Lounge yes I guess this means we lost it does and it also means that we are the coolest teachers hey good try Matthew we got you baby this is my first time ever having detention by the way that's two days for lion"

about to build our Dream living room we're going to spend the next 5 minutes finding the most cozy Furniture slick decor and high-tech gadgets we possibly can and then we're going to fuse them all together into a place where you can just chillax to the max so let's start with all the tech to be honest we don't even need to shop for this I think we know what TV we're getting yeah it's got to be the frame frame TV every time I see it I never realize it's actually a TV until someone turns it on it does look shockingly like a real piece of art and you can change it you can have art you can have photos okay let's pull the trigger expensive start okay so speakers we could do ceiling speakers we could do like a sound bar across the bottom do you know what I think I think because this is like the room where you're going to want to just recline and get blasted by what's a cool thing to listen to I I just feel like this this is a really cool room to have like big floorstanding high-fi speakers bank and olison I'm curious what they would do man I normally feel like bang an olivon gets it right but that it's the culmination of B's wildest dreams nightmares you got kef they also make really really good speakers oh yeah so Meridian the same company who's doing the audio in our Cinema room they also have floor standing speakers let me just get the Meridian Meridian natural nut and Seed Butters I've actually had those they're really good oh already audio okay so you can go gloss black satin white honestly like these figures are so so expensive but this has been like one of my dream things to O for a really long time so right after we filmed this spying section we actually went to go check out this Meridian floor Stander in person and I fell in love not even just with the sound but the engineering like you see this separate head that you have for your higher notes this thing is so isolated from the main body that I was able to balance a coin sideways while the thing was still blasting at full volume so we got them okay lighting so we've tried quite a few different Lighting systems in our old house we've tried goie Nano Leaf um lifx the best one in my experience has always has been Phillips okay so Phillips H they're definitely very expensive for what they are every time you see one of their bulbs you just think my God like $40 what is it made of yeah what is it made of exactly think we want a couple of like maybe in the corner here oh in the corners of the room just kind of bleeding onto the wall oh that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's interesting there it is and it's got wood and it's got and it's got a wooden base and it's got a high Hefty price wow such a good match for the room that it would be rude not to yeah I agree so table lights there's actually quite a few different options what are we doing I don't know let's get some irises light strips do we want any light strips underneath the sofas under the sofa I think makes a lot of sense give it that kind of floating feel the only Annoying Thing about Phillips is you then also have to buy a separate Hue Bridge it's a necessary evil I think that's all the lighting we need what else do we need in this room I was thinking some kind of really nice scent diffuser so I found them called the hotel collection wa our Tower scent diffuser uses Cutting Edge cold air diffusion technology it's called Mist so each of these oil refills is inspired by the scents in different famous hotels Star Wars The Empire so it's high-end hotels or smell like Star Wars or on Earth you can choose to smell like deed ey or Sith can you imagine in the movie they pull out their lights him as they're like what are you weing I think we should get the dark side it's also buy one get one 80% off so I feel like that makes a lot of sense okay let's do it what else do we need in this room what are you thinking like what is this room this room's kind of like a happy place isn't it you know board games books Pokémon well we've been looking for a place to C all of the stuff we have we have the Pokémon binders the cards the plushies should I bring the I don't know what you're talking about a few moments later we have the plushies oh the these are adorable let's get Pokémon into this room I'm actually on board I think we could do it in a really nice subtle way or not subtle imagine if we had like a cabinet spanning that entire wall and it's just filled with just things that we find fun like Pokémon if you would like to look for some Pokémon stuff I'm okay with that oh Pokémon Center that's what I'm going to find you doing I really like we lord it's really cool Pokémon I'm on board I'm going to call your Blu R add to baset well I was saying maybe this can be you know when um Jo do as montages I think that's it now for stuff okay that was fair let's do Furniture we found what looked like the perfect place online but um it's a good thing it's was an interior design place the game plan for this visit was to leave with our Dream sofa coffee table side chairs and bookshelf all locked in right time to bounce on some sofas do you mind by of course oh no that is not bouncy well but plenty work oh sorry after many bounces we started to figure out what we wanted we realized that a curved sofa was the best way of keeping people close together for both conversation and games but also that the material matters with sofas the two key types of cushioning are foam which is cheaper it holds its shape better and it's firmer and then feather which really properly lets you sink in but can start to look a little bit scruffy over time after a lot of searching though we found one which was curved it was made with foam so it retained its shape but it was really soft foam so it almost had that plushness of feather yes yes now we just needed some lounge chairs to accompany that sofa it's an instant plus two points if something swivels I like swiel chairs oh my God actually really comfy and it rotate it's actually really nice try it and this was the moment we realized we just found our Dream chair we also found a coffee table that we absolutely loved we initially came into this thinking that we wanted something higher but having actually sat around these low tables I could just see all of the amazing board game nights we could have gathered on the floor around something cozy like this now we just have to put it all together I sketched out where I wanted everything to go adding in a massive rug as well that complemented the curve of the sofa and also at this point realized that we basically just turned our living room into a smiley face what was very cool though is that the company then in about 20 minutes turned that little handdrawn sketch into an actual two-scale drawing featuring the exact sizes of all the pieces we picked all we needed now was a bookcase to finish it all off I mean this is is basically exactly what we've been looking for just like giant Pokémon statues everywhere who needs board games and books but what colors do we go for for all this stuff we're naturally bold color people so this screams to me this face right here says it all she asked me to try again so I did we would probably pick something like bring in books and Decor like this not main pieces and you know what this was good advice drisha and I are both naturally drawn to very bright colors but I feel like if we'd actually gone for the rainbow we initially came in looking for our room would have lost a lot of sophistication and there is one more benefit of keeping things a little more muted which I'm coming to we slowly saw this room come together over the next few weeks first the sofa and the rug then the cabinet behind then honestly the best part was filling it we have had so many things boxed up for so long you know wedding gifts games we've been wanting to play and in one Fell Swoop we've been able to get everything out and then we managed to get in a few extra additions things we didn't realize we wanted initially and things that we didn't even think we could fit into this space and that leaves us with the final product welcome to the living room and instead of just going around and pointing at stuff I think the best way to show you just how cool this room is is to show you the four key rules that we've made sure we followed and why those have paid off big time so this is going to seem like a really strange thing to say but number four is neutrality we first came into this thing wanting to plaster the entire room with a rainbow of bold colors and if that's your thing then you should by all means go for it but the reason that I'm so glad we ended up keeping all the key pieces the rug the chest the sofas all a little bit more reserved is that we can rethe this room whenever we want to so you can see right now we got a blue theme going on here right well not anymore all we have to do is to swap a couple of plushies and the whole mood of the room changes and there's two pieces of tech that are making this retheming so easy the first is the Philips Hue Lights for which we've got the two irises we bought in this cabinet we've got the floor standing lamp in the corner over there and then beneath the sofa the Philips hue light strip and I got to say if you were just going to do one of these get the sofa light this one strip makes such a difference to the vibe of this room I mean it's mood lighting while also elevating the design of your sofa literally think half looks like it's floating I guess because you would expect there to be Shadow beneath that so when instead you see light it makes it look weightless we found that the floor lamp is a little bit more situational you need to have a corner that you can stick it into you need to have matching walls so that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb and you need to have a nearby plug socket so that it doesn't create a mess but do all of that and I think it does add enough of a kick of color to be worth the hassle the Philips Hue irises are somewhere in between the two I'd say they look just as gorgeous as I was hoping they would and I also love how the way that they're angled upwards means that they give you both lighting at eye level but also Lighting on the ceiling above you which means that together with the lights underneath the sofa you're kind of surrounded by whatever color theme we decide to go for only thing I would say is given how much of a chungus this light actually is it's not putting out a whole lot of light it could be a little brighter and again so could I and then the second part of this theming equation is the Samsung frame TV and having used this for a little bit of time now I have thoughts so on one hand when you think about it from an art perspective the value proposition here is absolutely insane you can very easily pay what this TV costs for one painting the size of this TV except if you go for this TV you get unlimited art pieces that you can change up in seconds now obviously it's not exactly the same as discovering a quaint little Art Shop finding a piece you absolutely love and learning everything about it but if all you wanted to do was to display a bunch of jpeg images then this TV does actually make those jpegs look very much like real art especially if you can find images that have natural brush Strokes in them and it doesn't even waste a lot of energy the thing actually has sensors built inside of it that are designed so that the TV displays art when you're in the room and then it gets rid of the art and turns itself off when you're out of the room with I would say about 97% Effectiveness not to mention this is a full-on 4K TV with internet with apps with speakers and it's quite a good TV at that I was very much expecting compromised image quality cuz that's what the early Samsung frames were like but now we're at the 2024 generation it feels pretty Flagship the only real issue that I've had with it is with the Samsung smart things app that you have to use to put art onto it it feels quite buggy and I've had nothing unfixable but probably four to five times in the last few weeks where the app is not doing what I want it to but overall I would say this is an A+ tier product now even more important than all the colors and the theming is if we actually wanted to make this the perfect switch-off space then how do we make it as relaxing and as fun as possible so that's partly the obvious thing of just keeping stuff we like so a big part of that for me is as you can probably tell all of this Pokémon stuff I've been collecting for the last 15 years Pokémon gets Prime position in this cabinet apart from drer who's right here this was a bunch of the stuff that I used for my proposal which I still can't quite to this day believe we pulled off we've got all of our favorite board games down here there's a very early collection of limited edition playing cards in here and then also just generally while we have filled most of the rooms in this house with sharp lines everywhere because it makes things look clean with this room in particular we wanted to make sure it was filled with curves because it makes it look friendlier but then the other side to this equation is how do you create the systems to be able to have as much fun as possible I know organize fun it's the best kind so one thing that I'm very proud of is this this is the drisha UR gaming leaderboard so every single game we play together goes on this side made with tiles from Scrabble which is one of the games by the way and then we spent a while trying to find the most bedazzled pins that we could use to represent each Victory so purple is her blue is me and we are uncannily close to 50/50 right now but I think this is such a good idea it adds so much tension to everything you do together knowing that there will be public humiliation when you lose and then these frames going all the way across the wall are for our holidays we spent about 4 years trying to figure out what souvenir we should collect when we go away somewhere we love the idea of getting something but it's just that for us most mugs and fridge magnets just feel a little bit like clutter So eventually we decided let's just immortalize the best photo we take and that becomes our souvenir and it's just really fun because it's like a subquest every time you're away on holiday where we are trying in the background to get that Banger photo knowing that if we love it enough there's a space for it it's pillar number two though where things start to get juicy convenience how do you make the room as functional as possible and as easy to use as possible for people without making it look tacky step one hide some Wireless charges I love having friends over but having had friends over for many many years I've come to the realization that the average person doesn't think as much about bringing their charging cable with them as us techies might and so I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is instead of having to go to the top floor and rummage to find a cable with the right connector to now just be able to say hey pass me your phone drop it on there and done because yeah each of these pokeballs are actually 15 watt fast wireless chargers oh yeah if you're wondering by the way how I've hidden the cables in this room two things I would suggest one get cables as close to the colors of your surface as possible so for example everything that's wired in in this cabinet uses a black cable and everything that's against one of the house walls uses white cables and then two is these transparent sticky pads this might just be the OCD part of my brain talking but I absolutely love how these can make sure that your cables are running only in the very corners and crevices and because they're transparent they themselves practically disappear I've shown you that we've got board games what I haven't shown you is well how you can take the nerdiness to a whole other level so wherever possible we've actually bought 3D printed inserts to make sure that every piece inside has a place both inside the box and also outside when you're playing these drinks tables have been absolute game changers I wasn't completely sure when we first got them but having used them now they get used more than the main table cuz they give you the freedom to sit wherever you want to sit to have a drink to hand and also to not worry about spilling the thing cuz let me tell you even though they don't look it these bad boys are heavy we have hidden an extension lead underneath the sofa in case you need to charge a Macbook although that is not encouraged in this room and it will result in a formal War morning but the single biggest game changer for convenience is something that you don't usually see this is homie they're sponsoring this video and from everything I've tested this is the most intuitive way to control your home cuz if you've ever tried to make your own Home Smart before there's a very good chance you have also come to the realization that it's a mess it feels like every other one of these smart gadgets uses a different communication standard and so they don't talk to each other but homie brings them all together into one app so I've created an automation called fire side mode it took me less than a minute to do that by the way and when I tap this one command the Philips Hue Lights all change to Orange the room lights turn off very quickly my turn it turns on the scent diffuser which you'll notice is a little different to the one we first bought that Hotel Collection one was great you'd actually be amazed how great it smells on the dark side but we started to realize that it was far bigger than it needed to be for this kind of space and that its remote was the most fiddly non-smart little thing that needed far too much manual control so we swapped it out for the rituals diffuser that's been a lot better better and also happens to look amazing in the homie app it even turns on the fireplace which is bioethanol by the way so it takes a second to get going but if you are trying to build an indoor fireplace it is the way to go it doesn't release any smoke which is better for the environment but also you and then it also starts playing Smooth Jazz from these absolute monoliths all of these different devices being controlled through well basically one button on one app is absolutely insane and that brings me to the number one part of this room the media experience and there's more to this than just the frame TV so first up these are the Meridian DSP h000 xes it's just called them the meridians we spent so much time back and forthing on whether or not we should go for speakers of this insane value but these have ended up lifting this room so much I think even from an aesthetic standpoint these things look so cool just futuristic and yet also really clean but it's the sound that is pristine to try and paint a very vague picture the speakers that you have on the very best iPhones have about 3 watts of power the speakers that we put into our biggest iPhone ever that were kitted out to the Moon those were 400 WS These Guys 3,840 wats these things have the base power of Hi-Fi systems genuinely eight times their size and it's so weird listening to them because you're sitting here and you're expecting to hear one two speakers but what you're actually hearing is this all-encompassing surround sound because of how these things are designed to fire well actually most of their output sideways but then this is the creme La Creme of this room so open up homie again tap movie mode which is the second automation I've made and three things happen the Phillips Hue Lights go to 50% brightness and all turn red the Samsung TV turns on and opens up Netflix and the blinds come down and honestly the best part of homie Pro is that it works locally without the cloud all with energy monitoring insights and an entire community of users all making insanely cool things that you can do with your Home Products so these blinds I spent a long time searching for the right blinds for this house and we ended up going for a company called luxaflex which we got from CP Interiors because obviously when you bring your blinds down it's going to reduce the amount of light coming in and the amount of glare on your screen but these things also have really good acoustic properties so one part of that is reducing the amount of outside noise that comes in but the other part of that is when you're sitting here watching a movie reducing the amount of inside noise that hits it and gets reflected back at you it's enough of a difference that even someone who's not completely dialed into audio quality can straight away tell there's much less Echo and the sound is way more precise and now while the sofas are cool and all this has to be the greatest seat to sit and watch TV in so long story short about 2 years ago my mom was having some back pain so after a lot of research I found a massage chair from this company called weon we thought it was absolutely insane and then then just as we were putting this room together we realized the same company had released an upgraded model called the Grand presidential that also happened to perfectly match the neutral color profile of everything else and I genuinely think that this is the greatest massage chair on the planet it flips you into complete zero gravity it massages almost every part of your body from your neck to your toes even comes around you to do your shoulders it's got built-in heating it's got 140 airbags for compression you got a privacy Hood LED therapy and even built-in speakers although we won't be using those for obvious reasons and because the thing doesn't just recline but actually rotates on its axis it actually takes up way less space than we thought it was going to you know pretty much the entire time when people are over at the house we lose someone and then we realize 10 minutes later that it's because they're sitting in this chair and that is the dream living room I'll catch you during the week for normal Tech videos and then again on the weekend for the next episode in the house series bye"

technologically advanced Next Level Cinema and gaming room that you have probably ever seen I'm literally about to get a call in 8 minutes and on that call we actually need to lock in and buy the products that we might well be using for the rest of our lives and then we will set it up and we'll experience it together for the first time I cannot tell you how excited I am so when I first walked into this room here's how I thought this was going to go I thought oh cool the room already has such good noise isolation we're going to be able to get an awesome projector for like £5,000 speakers will probably be another 4,000 and then the blank screen maybe another, £10,000 total and it's going to be awesome but wow have we seen some crazy stuff you can do to take it further the first of which is this is going to be a gaming room just as much as it is a cinema room so we spent the first couple of days just deciding exactly which gaming consoles we wanted to fill it with adding in extra TVs and finding a way to hide them in the room and then realizing that we already hit our initial budget with that alone but things only started to get really crazy when we headed to a place called pulse Cinemas to find out what was possible with the audio and the projector parts of this dream Cinema room and it was super cool cuz these guys had actually built three different tiers of Cinema and each level introduced new layers of Technology but even their tier one Cinema system which by the way started at £30,000 had some very cool things going on like one problem that you need to solve if you're going for a high-end Cinema is you've got a massive screen in front of you right but then where do the speakers go yeah you can put them on the sides but we very quickly realize that you're going to get the best sound if at least some of those speakers are directly in front of you and facing you so learning number one is that you can't just stick like a whiteboard on your wall as your screen the best screens are made of woven fabric that is acoustically transparent so it doesn't interfere with the sound at all so that you can put some of your speakers behind it but there is a lot more that we've realized you can do and that we're going to try to do so that's going to diffuse the sound so it's going to reflect the sound back into the room if you just put absorption into a room it would sound like I know if you ever been to an an aoic chamber but it would just sound horrible oh dear so yes turns out you actually don't just want absorption like we have here if you're trying to build a perfect Cinema then you have to actually balance out audio absorption reflection and diffusion to make sure that the sound is traveling in the right way around your room the only remaining thing to do then was to settle into these Uber plush reclining chairs to actually see what this £3,000 investment results in my goodness heard a string instrument so deep and that's partly because this was a 7.2.4 surround sound system you actually see these numbers thrown around quite a lot in this world so just so you know the first number means how many main speakers you have the second is the number of subwoofers you have which handle your deep bass notes most casual home Cinemas will have one but these guys went for two and then the third number is the number of ceiling speakers if any just because those can add a whole extra Dimension so with that I was so curious what on Earth could tier 2 do well this was a £60,000 room and as well as the obvious projector and speaker quality upgrade the other immediately obvious thing is you can't see any of the speakers this room is showing how if you use the same acoustically transparent material as we previously had just for the screen for your walls 2 you can actually create a completely Next Level Bonker sound setup in which you see no speakers and that's so cool but also it's at this sort of what I would call very high price here that you start to come into another conundrum so most home Cinemas will need some sort of power amplifier as the brains to process all the audio and video signals to give you the ports to connect up to audio speakers and to provide the power needed to drive them but when you get to the high end you start to realize that you're going to get better performance if you split this functionality into multiple boxes so having a completely separate box dedicated just to processing and upgrading your audio signals and then another just for upgrading your video signals and that's what they've introduced with this setup so we tested it any carrier in the sector please respond seeing of my bones it's actually quite hard to describe to you how ridiculously impressive this second setup was like my legs were actually shaking when the bass notes hit okay so tier three o wow wo wo W now as you can probably tell I was trying to keep my call cuz you know you never want to get too excited around people trying to sell you stuff but my God I mean this might just be the prettiest room I've ever seen full stop but then the guy introduced me to what this room is really about it's actually more to do with the Troff it's an in-house developed system to give you the ultimate base experience in what it gives you is the seat to se consistency of Base I spent about 30 full minutes trying to get to the bottom of what this trinov actually is and long story short this Cinema system which by the way is priced at £300,000 has four powerful subwoofers at the front those subwoofers fire out a wave of Basse anytime there's a low note in what you're watching or playing and then the back of the cinema is lined with four more of the exact same subwoofers and this is where it gets interesting because these are called the absorbing array which basically sends out the same signal that the front is sending out but just inverted in order to cancel that sound out and then slightly delayed by the amount of time that it takes the front sound to reach the back of the room and so trinov is basically the processor that allows super advanced stuff like that to be calculated but why well essentially to make sure that Bas doesn't reverberate it booms you feel it in your soul and then it cuts to Dead Silence again to give you the maximum possible a audio dnamic range the ability for one moment to be explosive and the next to be a whisper so we had to listen to this absolutely Bonkers tier 3 setup and yeah I had never experienced anything like that before the sound was just bongers like it felt like a sphere around my head and the music was swimming in my brain but no obviously we didn't just see that and then buy that I mean we've spent a lot of time in showroom since we've seen screens that can actually extend to match the aspect ratio of your movie or game we've seen audio processing boxes taller than I am that actually have eyes for some reason and we've seen seating my friends seating so so comfortable that oh my God I swear at some points I was physically unable to pay any attention to what the sales guy was telling me and so this is what I'm thinking right now we found a company called Meridian Audio who's going to do our speakers out of everything we tried they were the we're going to end up going for I can't quite believe I'm saying this but 21 speakers and 12 subwoofers and then to finish the whole thing off we managed to find not just an acoustically transparent screen but also an acoustically transparent fabric that's going to cover every single wall so you don't see a single speaker and projector wise I initially came into this thinking I was going to get a Sony or a JBC you know the consumer facing Brands but through our travels to these various showrooms rooms we found this company called Barco and they usually deal directly with businesses so i' never heard of them but the brightness of those projectors versus the jbc's it's actually a big difference maybe because they're designed for bigger commercial Cinemas and the seating we decided it has to be the masterminds that made this thing right here and turns out that is a company called movia who seem to have a whole load of different base designs and materials but then they're also completely modular so you can actually configure the exact arrangement of those designs so this guy's going to call in about a minute the price really adds up when you start adding arrays of speakers hi Aon how you doing so we've had a look through the quote we're happy to go ahead with it that's brilliant that's great news even small private Cinemas that are run by film clubs and stuff like that very few of them get to this sort of level it's going to be probably one of the very best private Cinemas in this country and we're going to be playing smash on it we're going to be plugging a Nintendo switch into it yeah wow now I thought from the point of placing that order this would be a one-month job yet again foolish ambition it actually took 4 months for a few reasons we had to tear down every single existing panel on the walls we had to fit four ceiling speakers 12 subwoofers and 17 wall speakers which to be honest the only crazier thing than hearing that number is seeing it remember every one of these speakers contains multiple speaker cones then we had to refit new panels on top in a very carefully controlled combination of super high quality noise is ation pads with the very best sound diffusion panels we could find all painted black and then finished with our acoustically transparent black fabric going around the whole room and then finally because the team who was building it had to do a lot of testing constantly tweaking the arrangement of things using this multi-array microphone to check the results at each stage until it was just perfect and that is now inside this room is one of the greatest Cinema room and gaming rooms ever created and I haven't even tested it yet we're about to do it together on camera and I am about to pee myself with excitement [Music] welcome so I'm going to take you around the room like this and it's just going to keep building starting with the console cabinet weirdly this is one of my proudest achievements ever we started out with a plain cutout in the wall and we quickly realized two issues one that all the consoles are different heights so you had just a ton of waste space but the bigger issue was cables we had like 30 different cables trailing all over the place because I am obsessive to an annoying level I didn't just want the consoles to be powered on I wanted to create a space where every single controller of every console is also always plugged in always fully charged and so with a bunch of carefully placed plants false walls and shelves we have actually pulled that off you basically can't see a cable so what Hardware did we go for well from left to right you can see we've got four PlayStation five Slims there's actually a very good reason for that which I'm getting to but what I want to show you now is one of the key problems that we were trying to avoid which is what console does this controller connect to then I remembered that Sony themselves actually sell alternate colored plates and then realized that they also sell controllers that matched to the color of those plates so yeah one thing led to another and now we have four color matched ps5s which is just surreal there's the PlayStation portal here which again does actually charge here it's like secretly connected magnetic to a very stealthy cable behind it this is a console that's had a little bit of a character Arc for me when it first released I thought wow that's a very overpriced empty piece of Hardware but as soon as you have really good stable internet and also you have a specific use case for it in mind it can be an absolute Game Changer like it is in this set this thing plays a pivotal role in what we're trying to do here then this is a 1 tbte Xbox series X this is basically just for Halo I've been obsessed with Halo ever since I was like 10 years old and since Halo already has four player split screen on one console it'd be absolutely silly to get four Xboxes also I absolutely love these razor Chargers we've got for all the Xbox and PlayStation remotes we went through a lot of different ones ones with RGB lighting ones that tried to match the designs of the consoles nothing beats the look The feel and the quality of these and then of course we have the Nintendo switch corner and as silly as it does feel to have this little tablet that's like a third of the power of a modern day phone Nintendo makes great games and the fact that on just one of these things you can have eight people playing multiplayer games at 60 frames per second will forever be an embarrassment to everything on that side you got to love the optimization and then in here this has always been a dream of mine to do so for a long time we've used these knockoff Nintendo switch Pro controllers they're very customizable they're fun to look at but they're a little cheap and you can kind of tell and somehow three of the four of those controllers I use have managed to develop some form of joystick drift not this time I wanted to do everything in this house to the highest possible standard we wanted to have the best controllers with also the best customization so every single one of these switch controllers is an official Nintendo switch Pro Controller but custom painted by colorware and I cannot believe how good it's turned out oh yeah and the final thing in this console cabinet seems really boring but is actually so cool this is an HDMI Matrix so this connects every single output device like a PlayStation an Xbox and Nintendo switch with every single input device in this room because yes there are multiple screens here so every single device in this entire room is allocated one of these numbers and then you just tap these buttons to decide which screen those devices can display their image on now up here we've got two side cabinets so these were not here when we first got the house we got them made because there's a few extra things that we wanted to add to this room starting with the tech shelf now to most people this is probably going to look like a dumpster fire but I'm hoping given that you're watching this video you will see this for the arch piece that it is so these two are making sure that every device has the fastest internet and the fastest data transfer like everything where possible is wired not wireless then you got a layer of plugs and this isn't fun but I think it's really important when you're building a room like this where you might be powering something that's sitting on the other side of it that you just label them so you know what's what now underneath that is something called the Blue sound node and the only reason that we have that is just so that we can use our phones to play music through this ridiculous Meridian sound system which on one hand yes seems like a really strange thing to have to do in 2024 and the era of Sonos speakers which have that capability built inside of them already but basically you'll find when you get to really high-end sound systems everything is separate partly because they work in slightly old-fashioned ways but mostly because splitting up the functionality of each device allows you to get devices that do each function at the absolute maximum so there's no bottlenecks and then below that we've got the lumagen and the reason we have this box in very simple terms is it makes things look better we've got so many different devices in this room all connected to the same displays you know Nintendo switch Xbox PlayStation there's an Apple TV box behind here as well the lumagen takes in all of these inputs and just make sure that when they come out of it they are corrected in every way possible and then we've got this absolute unit of a box the trinov audio like you've seen this thing's like a super computer designed with the sole purpose of audio processing and there is something really cool that we've managed to pull off in this room thanks to the power of this box but we're getting there and then this there's a freezer it freezes things wow anyway I am so happy with how this thing came together so this is a PC it's designed by PC specialist specifically for virtual reality they have this very fun and very dangerous configurator when you're picking what you want but eventually we decided on this absolutely Bonkers specification so RTX 490 graphics card 24 core Intel Core I9 up to 6 GHz Herz 8 terab of M2 Solid State Storage 64 GB of RAM and the entire thing is also water cooled just to keep it as quiet as possible and when the thing arrived that was all the stuff we expected what we didn't expect is just how handsome the thing is we originally allocated the top half of that shelving cabinet just to store the thing we took it out the box saw how the black perfectly matched the background the wood paneling here perfectly match the sofas so we just decided it has to be here this just makes sense this is actually the first time I get to try it headset controllers oh by the way this is actually a really cool time to show you the control 4 Halo touch so technically all of these are remotes for something in this Cinema room this is the only one we actually need every single one of these normal remotes is designed to have one purpose whereas this remote is connecting to the hardware in the house on a deeper layer and so I can do basically anything on this like for example if I click lighting here and then I go into scenes we have five different lighting modes each creating a different mood in this room but the reason I'm showing you this now is if I click this watch button here this is every single input device in this entire Cinema room all the PlayStation 5 the Xbox series X Nintendo switch and the vrpc so all I have to do is to tap on that PC button and the PC goes through the HDMI Matrix and starts displaying on this main screen this is absolutely insane so I am streaming right now from the PC which means you're able to play VR games at a level of graphical Fidelity you would not be able to with the headset alone oh and there's like no latency at all and then for the headset it might seem like a little bit of a strange decision why we went for The Meta Quest 3 because you know I was saying we wanted the best of the best for everything in this Cinema room and you can get a lot more fancy and a lot more expensive VR headsets than this there is a whole world of ultra specialized extremely Cutting Edge headsets but this is the one that I keep coming back to because if all you want to do is game then they are all worse than the actually quite simple meta Quest 3 mostly because of how much more reliable the software is on this thing then you got the sofas and the reason that I fell in love with this is as far as the comfort's concerned you cannot tell this is not a normal sofa but it's actually kind of Hightech so I mentioned before that one of the main perks of this is that it's modular meaning that each one of these segments is its own piece that you can kind of chop and change to put together like pieces of Lego which means we've managed to get a sofa that perfectly fits the space we wanted leaving just enough gap on either side it means we've been able to specifically select the feature set that we want in the armrest so I just think this is so cool if you pull this back you've got a drinks holder with an RGB configurable light on the inside and a chi charger for your phone people are always asking for Chargers when they come to your house so it's tough to describe how much joy it brings me that now I can just say to them stick your phone in the armrest but this is the cherry on top it also means that every single one of these seats has its own three-part movable skeleton underneath so you reach your hand into this kice you can adjust the foot rest you can adjust the headrest and you can also with a different button adjust the depth of the thing and it comes out so far it is almost bed-like which is just insane considering how compact it is I'm not exaggerating when I say this thing is hideously expensive for seating but at the same time it is the best movie sofa I've ever experienced we did end up going for the barcode projector which has a 5k resolution and you can kind of tell that it's commercial grade by the fact that it has an actual display on the side so that someone in a viewing area can actually see a preview of what's being projected out the front now this is cabinet thei this is a simple one but it's no less fun basically all of our favorite snacks and we thought that this area here would actually be really nice to pour yourself a drink in but since we don't actually have any bottles yet it is filled with Pringles then this is a well not so many bridge and the thing that I think is particularly cool here is is how it's integrated it's quite easy for a white fridge and some cheap snacks to stand out like a sore Thum in a room like this but the way we've done the paneling and used the same acoustic fabric that we have across the entire Cinema room on this Cabinetry as well makes it feel like a part of it bean bags so these are from whoa a company called vet saac and they're about twice as big as I was expecting them to be the box came into the house and I was thinking oh that seems a little small but cute then I opened it and the thing fraking exploded in front of me you then have to leave them out for 48 hours too fluff and here we are I knew we wanted bean bags in this house ever since we did a team retreat in an Airbnb 2 years ago and that place had swapped out every single sofa with a bean bag and it just it changed the entire Vibe it created such a feeling of calm which I loved so the reason why we've got four ps5s here the reason why we've got an HDMI Matrix half the reason why this room exists is because of this button right here Co-op gaming and while this happens I want to explain to you why I've chosen to use surf Shar VPN for our Cinema room PC so you probably know how most vpns work oh my God it's actually working they take your traffic they root it through one of their servers so that all the website on the other end can see is the details of that server and that's already pretty cool but surf shark uses Nexus technology meaning that every one of their servers is connected and that surf shark can bounce you between all of them on the fly without dropping your connection and that's pretty Next Level because it means you're even more difficult to track cuz you can have a new IP address every single time you click a new link and instead of your data being massed through one server your data can be massed through an entire network of servers and you'll get even better speeds because as soon as a faster server opens up you can be rooted through that instead automatically and if you go to Sur shark.com boss you can now get it at the all-time lowest price ever $1.99 a month for an unlimited number of users with four extra months for free oh my God I can't I can't actually believe this and they're all on automatically just give me a second to take this in so this is two LG G4 OLED TVs these things are 55 in 4K resolution the pit quality is amazing and each one is mounted to by far the most Bonkers mechanism I've ever seen in my life so this is from a company called future automation it can project the TV down a whole meter it can swivel in 360° and it communicates with control 4 which means that from this remote I can set the precise centimeter and angle that this TV is positioned at also each mechanism weighs of 200 kg so getting those into the ceiling was actually the single hardest part of this entire project this is it this is it oh my God this is a dream I've probably had for the last 5 to 10 years and today it has finally come true I can hear bullets all around me I can see what you guys are up to in my peripheral vision every like gunshot has so much weight to it it's insane it's done nothing for our performance the skill level is incredibly low on this battlefield and you can hear it behind you yeah you can hear everything like you actually instantly know where the enemies are oh yeah and you want to know the most Bonkers part of this whole thing because of that Trin of superc computer sitting in the cabinet the sound from each person's game can be directed towards the seat that they'll be sitting in so everyone hears a slightly different mix of audio tailored to what they're noticing on their screen while still getting the background from what's happening on everyone else and this is also where the PS portal comes in it connects to the white PS5 for player 4 so even though there's three main screens we can still do four friends online co-op gaming in the same game at the same time just nuts and this is the pieace resistance so let's say that after gaming I want to watch something okay so you pull up Apple TV Play trailer and then there is a mode baked into here because yes we did go for a motorized screen hit movie H ridiculous absolutely ridiculous it happens so smoothly I can't believe it is that supposed to be scary the R rating isn't new for me friend but it is for Disney oh my God you know the thing that's hardest to communicate through video is how the sound envelops you in the content you just feel like like all these walls they're actually speakers behind them you're being blasted from every single angle and it just pulls you in it's the best sound I've ever heard in any Cinema ever next episode is the living room which we have equally spicy plans for"

I'm greasy what about it first thing in the morning haven't showered worked out right before bed didn't shower big whoop H can't handle a little grease get out of the kitchen last night was the game awards where Jeff Keeley teab bagged us all with some big announcements and some big Awards and there's a few things I want to talk about first of all that was the biggest stream I've ever done in my life I had 110,000 Peak concurrent viewers on YouTube and 20,000 on Twitch 13,000 total viewers on one of my live streams is unfathomable to unfathomable to me can't even get the words out so huge thanks to you for anyone that tuned in that was cool big thanks to Jeff Keeley for making my biggest stream of all time I mean I worked really hard on watching the game awards this year I put a lot of work into my reactions so I'm glad to see that this was the stream that popped off so big for me but there's just a aside from that there's some things I want to talk about with like the announcements as well as the Big Talk of the Town game of the year first and foremost there were some big announcements that I absolutely think are worth getting excited for some [ __ ] that I don't think even bab aanga would have predicted were revealed at the awards show here I know there's a ton of naysayers saying nothing good got shown it all looks like trash but I would say don't listen to the paint ship eating weirdos that are still soiling their diapies like that is actual delusion like sure you can say oh I'm not really looking forward to you know maybe the next Elden ring game which I'm going to get into in a moment because it it seems it's going in a weird Direction but to say that there were no good announcements blows my mind we got a [ __ ] Okami sequel announcement for God's sake can you I don't I feel like people that think there was nothing good shown here don't actually play games because that alone is huge we got a new Oni Musha a new Virtual Fighter to keep in mind Virtual Fighter hasn't had a new real game since 200 [ __ ] s we got a a new game from the Shadow of the Colossus team like these are huge games that I cannot wait to see like these are OG from back in like the Golden Era of really creative works so I'm super excited to see a new iteration into these franchises like I think that's really exciting and then for new franchises they announced project Century look which looks really good naughty dog's got a new IP hey I'm breaking the timeline here I just showered but I have to replace this section here as I was listing new IPS that they announced last night so that's why my hair is wet instead of greasy now just want to peel back the curtain on that a little bit on on why it changed so drastically but some of the other IPS that they announced that look great first Berserker Kazan dispatch the Pac-Man secret level game Shadow Labyrinth like there's just a lot they showed that I actually think is super cool so I was really impressed with the trailers and really surprised that people thought there was nothing good that they revealed it actually baffles my [ __ ] noodle up here that anyone would think that I really think it's people just wanting everything to be bad so they'll put on their biggest frown and just pretend that it was all negative and it's all lame throwaway shovel Weare the gaming industry is so cooked I I also just forgot they revealed a new turac there hasn't been a new turo since 2008 I used to make montages on the 2008 turo game when I was still in [ __ ] middle school turo as an IP has been dead and dusted for almost two decades the last time I touched the new turoc game I hadn't even held a girl's hand and now in 2024 we get a [ __ ] turoc announcement how is that not hype like it just I don't understand why everyone is so desperate for everything to be the worst can Poss possibly be even when there is like real positive [ __ ] that they showed from the announcements that's exciting and gaming I think AAA gaming is kind of cooked like at least Western devs it's been [ __ ] floundering left and right I've talked about this a lot but where the AAA space is eating ass the rest of the world is blessing us with great games like we haven't had this many International releases to this quality ever and Indie Games have never been better like the gaming industry as a whole I think is in a good space and I think it's a good thing that some of these Legacy AAA studios are eating so much [ __ ] like Ubisoft I I Spit on Ubisoft every chance I get I've been Hawking lugies at them for many many months now but they deserve it like they they are they are digging their own grave they just released a [ __ ] nft game in 2024 like come on so while Ubisoft might be having this cartoonish fall where they're just perpetually slipping on ice as their stock price continues to plummet where they might not make it there will be other games that will fill that void and they'll probably get bought by 10cent I really think Ubisoft will end up getting bought by 10cent I don't think that's going to save any of the properties that they have but that's my My Little Game Theory my hypothesis there there what we'll have is more room for great games like a black myth Wukong or great indie games like a nine Souls still very upset nine Souls didn't get a single nomination by the way anyway though I'll stop going on on that tangent let's talk about something I just briefly mentioned that I talked about quite a bit during the stream the new Elden ring night rain when they first showed it man I was kicking my little feet in my chair I was so happy it's clearly not a battle royale the night is I'm so [ __ ] hyped I really oh my God the nameless King I'm going to come Jiminy Christmas that guy just just has an eagle for AE that's the most American patriotic [ __ ] I ever [Music] seen so it's not DLC they said it's a standalone so it's a new Elden ring game all that excitement soon turned to excrement the more I learned about it the more I started to get more and more worried and kind of [ __ ] on the concept so night rain is a Rog uh Co-op survival Boss Rush type experience with Battle Royale elements like that bird you saw right there is actually like their battle bus according to the people that played oh it's painful like I have nothing but faith in fromsoft but I am really concerned that this might be their first blemish and this is not with Sony buying kakawa yet so this is this is a from soft decision and I I'm going to I like I'm going to be honest sports fans I I'll play some clips from the stream where you can see the the realization wash over me that this might not actually be good but I think this really might not be very good I don't like the concept I do not think it makes a whole lot of sense for Souls game but I am willing to be proven wrong hoping I'll be proven wrong please don't let me down from soft The Vibes get even stranger when you see a battle royale style wall of deadly rain encircling the map and characters down dashing around on foot like the wait what night rain his Elden ring turbo condensed three player Rog likee with a little dash of Monster Hunter to it as you choose a final boss to face at the end of a 30ish minute run that's assuming you survived two days of the circle shrinking to focal points where someone in alt Lim grave each night culminating in its own tough boss battle I don't really love that yeah I know miyazaki's not on it that's what chat was saying but even still that that just seems like such a blatant cash grab I I don't I don't like that I mean maybe again I have nothing but faith in fromsoft in general but that direction I'm not super stoked on when I first started my when I started my first session by dropping on the map from a spectral bird the entrance was so fortnite coded I wondered if from software was joining the live service party with a battle pass seasonal event and $20 epic skins so that's what the bird was that they showed that's their that's their like battle dropping oh [ __ ] me oh yikes we wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase so everything is unlockable it's not what we'd consider a live service game we're still in the process of thinking about possibilities no PVP elements at all no invasions no esoteric multiplayer covenants we wanted to have a sense of accomplishment oh oh oh you don't use you don't put those words together you never put those words together ever uh-uh you never put sense of accomplishment like that man I'm I'm a little worried this might be from sof's first Miss and this isn't even Sony's fault this is before they're getting bought out by Sony [ __ ] well okay I'm counting my chickens before they hatch but man I like how do you even make that good that is like the antithesis to a Soul's experience like I think you can make a rogu likee work I think you can make Rog likee elements work what I'm not convinced you can make work is a battle royale influenced Boss Rush has Miyazaki son had any input in the game or is he strictly hands off on the project initially I took the idea to Miyazaki son who gave it the green light he was a little he was a little involved in that initial concept phase of the game but after that he gave full reain to me isn't looking good it's it's not it's it's not it's not sounding good but I guess we'll see man I'll give fromsoft the benefit of the doubt they haven't let me down yet but this this feels like something I'd expect them to do under Sony to be honest but it's not Sony this is this is something they just decided to do I'll go ahead and stop yapping about Elden ring and now let's let's blabber about the big one game of the year I've said for a while my game of the year was Blackmouth Wukong my favorite games of the year were black myth Wukong nine souls and Space Marine 2 I absolutely [ __ ] loved those three games astrobot I do think is a good game it wouldn't be my personal game of the year but that is what took home the gold medal come on Wukong I think it's going to be astrobot like I said I think I think it'll probably be astrobot game of the year is but I'm pulling for Wukong please asol damnn it [ __ ] I told you though there were a lot of people upset about this dubski from astrobot here especially during stream in the chat I think a lot of people didn't play astrobot because a lot of people kind of wrote it off as just being like a throwaway platformer even though it was like a game journalist darling that had like ens across the board trust in game journalists has never been lower for good reason just look at IGN they they're really going Hog Wild on fives for like actually good things like it's it's at a point where a lot of people don't really care what a game journalist review has to say about something so people didn't put a lot of stock into something like astrobot being an actually good game it is astrobot is a great game it was a wonderful game super fun full of Soul it has a lot of replayability but I do still feel personally that black myth Wukong was something a little more special astrobot set out to make a really good platforming game and it succeeded in a big way black myth Wukong set out on like a really unique path it's not like the most unique game like game the gameplay in it isn't something we haven't seen before but the complete package that it delivers is unlike a lot of things I've played because it comes from a Chinese developer that really tried to carve its own road with this game and I think they succeeded like it has so much style and so much to it like it took me 35 hours or something just to beat the game the first time around and that was without getting the true ending so the game has a lot of meat on its bones it never really overstays it's welcome somehow like it still constantly feels fresh it's challenging but not in a way that ever really felt unfun like I really like I've glazed Blackmouth Wukong plenty I'm sure all of you have heard me gushing Granny's over it I just really thought Blackmouth Wukong was Game of the Year for me Wukong did win players voice which was the 100% user voted game of game award so Blackmouth Wukong got the players Game of the Year award the people's Champion but I I just really did think that it was deserving of a game of the year win here not that I think astrobot isn't I just still felt Blackmouth Wukong was Stronger anyway though I just kind of wanted to talk a little bit about the game awards last night really that's about it see y"

play a lot of Minecraft if you guys couldn't already tell but since I'm a pro expert gamer I want to try games similar to Minecraft from free games all the way to Minecraft knockoffs that cost a

Roblox Channel with bricks so check out cookie blocks later the next game we're playing is called cube world and it's $23 which is the most expensive game so far which means it has to be the best

be a chest right here I don't see anything come on come on don't disappoint me here no I don't think they added a chest that by itself drops this a whole tier down oh my God what is that is that Goblin oh my God look at this Goblin I thought villagers were ugly oh he's sniffing me now oh now get away from me you creep there's a whole ship over there oh my God and this game has corals too in the ocean is there anybody in here housekeeping hello oh the chest a wall torch oh my God this guy's poor too wait why is this bed kind of advanced though oh you had a you had a nice thing let me just delete that and yep sink your boat there's also a Giant Eagle over here Minecraft doesn't have this dude there's a whole castle and everything there's so much to explore hey for only $7 I feel like I got my money's worth I'm not going to lie I'm going to give Block Story an a next up we got blockstorm with very positive reviews this guy said the game is Dead than my grandma there is literally only one other player playing this game in the world o I got to choose my character I'm going to be the Minotaur cuz look at him all right the other guy is I'm a twisted Jester with 470 ping this guy is literally playing on a toaster oven I I don't see him anywhere I have 9 minutes and 30 seconds to find this guy yeah it's been like 6 minutes and I literally cannot find find this guy yo should I call the fire department for you this guy's computer and internet is probably on fire all right you know what I'm going to revive this Dead game I went to my cookie Army Discord server and told everybody to download this game and get on oh you guys already killing each other yo ch ch ch all get out of here bro get out of my game Who head is that me I jumped off the map hey yo from the sky y yeah you can shovel through the map oh my God we're literally mining wait you can place blocks with five wa what yeah this fortnite now y this wait we're playing a different game now oh one heart one heart wait one heart we're not mine this is Minecraft I don't know what Minecraft has guns yo come here boy yo stop stop stop oh you're so ugly I'm mining y you're so stup shoot your foot yes what are you going to do pull M I'm pulling up I'm pulling up how low are you how low are you yeah stay there stay there stay there Ru everybody has to use a knife to try to kill me I see everyone not oh you got close you got close right there right there back up back up back up back up no come on yes only knives only knives bro where the hell is mid what do you mean where's mid maybe the middle find you bro I've been ready oh no yes he got me yeah we single-handedly 10x the amount of players playing this game right now but yeah this game was actually a lot of fun so I'm actually going to give this an a all right this next game is called minor cat 4 and it's actually the first 2D Minecraft ripoff game that we're playing today all you do is literally just go mining collect ores and materials sell them and buy better stuff and for some reason it's just so addicting because it's so easy well it was pretty easy until I dropped into this cave what the what did I just step on and my stuff's burning bro my stuff oh my God all right yeah I see why now you can buy armor and weapons for a light $10 million or 250 trillion so I played this game for another 30 minutes to see how rich I can get and also because it was a little addicting that's why you don't dig straight down and I managed to earn yeah I didn't get very far I only have $7.3 th000 but this game gets kind of hard cuz if you drop too low all you run into is lava and mobs and they literally instantly kill you like I I can't do anything this is actually a very fun game but it's just a little grindy so I'm still going to give an a this next game is called zcraft and I think all you got to do is collect animals so um where oh I think I just sold the animals let me punch him until he becomes my pet go into the Hut I have no idea how this small little Hut is even holding all of these animals but we somehow are at least this is somewhat like Minecraft there's like wood there's fences there's like AAA Village right here but these animals I have no idea like what kind of oh my God a pink sheep wow oh that was so loud yeah I mean pretty pretty simple game oh wait I could go to the zoo I can open new locations for $50,000 I only have 166 yeah maybe in another lifetime I'll get that much money in this game I put this at a d this game is literally just called QB is this a total ripoff of Minecraft no this is a very relaxing enjoyable game with a neat Quest system and magic lockpicking and skills improve your yeah what he's trying to say is it's a copy of Minecraft let's buy for $10 and find out ourselves hey yo why wait wait why why did it start off so sexual but let's be a male let's be super white super short super broad shoulders big belly oh my god I'm an actual dwarf my shoulders barely go over this block okay I'm mining grass by throwing what a rock at it well this is looking pretty realistic there's another Scooby-Doo looking guy over here don't tell me what to do Dad I just want to be my own person I want I want to have my own I want to make my own choices I'm running away what the heck there's walking mushrooms yo you get away from me oh my God I'm running away this game does look super realistic look at the jonga snail why why is he attacking me why is he so so fast oh there's a cave yo I literally cannot even see what I'm mining right now all right I'm running right in Yolo swag oh my God I just fell down a giant cave oh I'm about to die I think I'm stuck how do I reset character like Roblox I can't okay QB I'm going to give it a a b next up is Sky lifee it's only $2.30 well before he even started playing my character was on a rectangle plane that just randomly fell out of the sky and blew up and I somehow landed on on this small little island so that's a great start and there are hundreds of islands all around me so this is basically like that first game that we played that really sucked so this time I actually have a hot bar I can mine the wood which is already a huge upgrade oh my God what is that is that a chicken yo what's up dude oh I actually get saplings too let's turn some logs into some planks let's go to this next Island all right at least I actually die in this game and lose items so there's not much that I can craft inside this game but my goal is to craft a bomb [Music] okay I'm on another Island what is this block oh my God it just blew up into snowballs wait it's eggs oh my God what is this I just got cow seeds this game might be weirder than the first Sky Block game okay well it's going to be very hard to get enough materials to head over to like one of these islands I'm already kind of like okay you know what we're we're not getting a bomb today yes it looked like Minecraft and it actually kind of worked but like it's kind of a grind so I'm going to put it at a B creativerse it's actually 50% off right now oh my God this is Asian man's dream this looks like Advanced Minecraft look at off the trees what are you why do you look like that oh my I'm like blowing him yo this why is this log Hollow if I left click I literally suck in blocks with this glove oh yeah so fast oh my God this is so easy and I'm handsome too look at my jawline oh wait I can go in attack mode let's kill this guy wait no way no way I just died to that ugly beast that's embarrassing there's a green one now m well this one doesn't attack back oh glob of Goo oh yo but this game actually looks like Minecraft like the world generation is almost the same as well what is this Daffy Duck a blizzard chard oh my God you can fly wait he does a lot of damage oh he's going to kill me oh never mind a feather suu and none of these animal drop food man yo I want to know who design these mobs kind of doesn't match this Vibe at all wait I have a flashlight no ah what and I can fly I got a built-in elytra in my back okay but now let's go mining a stone there's already Bedrock right here what I I'm not even deep into the ground I can literally see the sun yeah this game definitely deserves to be put in an a tier Castle Story all right this sort of looks like Minecraft I mean there's there's green there's trees and there's Steve looking dudes and diamonds that I need to protect let's go mine some trees guys yeah go go go yeah chop those trees down so what I'm supposed to do is protect this Crystal by bilding stuff around it let's build a stockpile right here here and here let's also put a weapons rack yo why is nobody building I'm so confused wait wait wait they're coming in I don't even have anything to do fight guys fight oh no we lost the solder he just split into pieces but yeah we lost let me play the tutorial real quick oh yeah wait they're all getting loaded up to protect this Crystal yo what are you doing this guy's leaving town oh here they come oh my God they're little Stone boys where wait wait wait wait wait leave leave bog alone no wait he's getting attacked run run run away no avenge bog where are you guys go and attack these guys oh we killed one we killed two let's get back to work I got B's orb it's his Spirit okay but all these guys are mining now and with all these materials that they're getting I can build some walls oh yeah now let's just watch them slowly build it yeah let's get some reinforced doors built yeah oh my God this guy just slapped it down so fast oh wait I'm missing the actual door I just got a door frame oh you need iron for that well that's the most protection we're getting just door frames not even walls or a door yo get them they're attacking the walls a good thing I built those yeah take them down to avenge bog yeah wait we did it yes oh my God B's back and he he went straight to work this guy this guy only knows about work all right but I already put in like 2 hours into this game and it's pretty fun but there's a lot to learn so I'm going to put it at an a next up is Colony survival and the very first review said says I like to have little slaves and 21 people agreed so buy it and we're in oh my God this is actually Minecraft too wait look at the grass it looks like a Minecraft Moss block the leaves have depth the render distance is so far with nice realistic clouds oh my God can I mine okay wait I need to start a colony and I have a bunch of people that I can command can I mine oh yeah the M the mining isn't that realistic honestly this world does look pretty insane though this island looks pretty nice to start a colony let's place down my Colony yeah yeah we're making a giant bed for all of my slaves I mean well treated workers let's also put down some crates and some torches oh yeah wheat farming I need stone tools I I don't even have that yet all 10 of these guys might starve all right all right you guys go to bed and I'll I'll go collect some Stone okay oh I hit gold wait this is Stone Rebel why is this so yellow oh I think I actually hit gold and Redstone doesn't matter of my fist it is copper and Clay you're telling me this is copper and that's clay that's clearly Redstone and gold you know what this also looks like grilled chicken nuggets for McDonald's Hey ryen Shine all right but let's go Harvest some wood cuz I think I need it oh my I just punched all those leaves away be gone disappear I wish I can do this to all the annoying people in my life like bam I can craft myself a tinker table all right who who wants to work okay well I think my recording crashed and um 30 minutes went by and all of my dudes are dying and we're also getting attacked by zombies look look at this leave him alone oh I just punched him to death leave us alone um I made a farm I have a bunch of more stuff but I have no food and everybody is starving so yeah I'm going to give this game an a the next game is pix Arc and everybody is saying this game is like Arc survival and Minecraft having a baby the depths of my autism can finally be Unleashed $48 18 gab while we wait why don't you guys hit that subscribe button down below all right this is me oh wait I'm fortn iting what the heck I just came off I just came out with the battle bus why am I walking on goofy why is there just a penguin in taking a bath in the water this guy does not care at all wait there's dinosaurs everywhere what is this can I kill it oh okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry wa wait wait I'm sorry protect me Turtle leave me alone okay he he this guy actually is oh my God the Frog's protecting me oh and I think the Frog died wait the Frog killed the Triceratops yo this is a female Paras all right I just insta what is this biome wait this is a warped Forest but in the Overworld okay but what can we actually do in this game can we punch a tree like Minecraft oh yeah I got some wood and I can actually build let me tame all of these dudes and ride them I'm making this guy moonwalk wait I got a living elytra guys they see me flying look look at his head okay it's not working but I'm dragging his face on the floor you know what I'm also going to give this game an A but now we're heading back to Minecraft and I paid a developer $300 so be be the most realistic Minecraft mod pack ever to exist and whatever one crashed and burned down my entire computer and my house and this is it Minecraft comes alive I can literally choose my character I'm I'm going to be feminine let's be a villager and I can even customize myself yo yo yo a yep here we go that's it I can choose my skin color oh my God I can literally be pink and now I literally just blend in with the screen you can't even see me frea homosexual albinism lactose intolerant all right I guess I'm lactose today all right and we spawn inside of a village oh my god look look at the shaders and just listen to the sound effects this sounds awesome oh my God look at me I can't even see my feet of how big those things are wait these villagers aren't even villagers did I talk to her Josh's mood is fine personality is witty and she likes jokes and she's bisexual hold up come back here let me Riz oh my God okay never mind BR just turned into a dude right when he walked through the door this is literally what saw in the other games that we were playing earlier but this looks like oh it even makes a ripple oh look at the ripples I'm making I'm actually riding these waves this doesn't feel like Minecraft anymore so this mod also changed snowballs look at it it actually balls on the floor it's rolling take that Geraldo wait this guy's waving his hands in here screaming for help oh my God the whole thing just collapses yo this is crazy can I break down this dude's entire house oh the whole thing just falling apart so what happens if you take a giant jungle tree like this and just break the bottom pieces it literally just falls apart look at it oh look at the leaves too wo I can literally walk through it and it just it just fumbles around I'm about to do something crazy look at it look oh my God it's like one of those Car Wash Flappy dudes what yo it's wrapping around me like a snake oh and look at the sun rays just like Shadow through these trees is this a cow why does he look like that wait oh my I'm picking him up yo how do I put him down wait can I just drop him into this water right here hold up oh alongside new B what the oh my God wait what happened if he oh wait I just blew apart I actually exploded but what I was trying to say was that planes were added yeah we're flying a plane in Minecraft I'm dolphin diving into it all right it's a submarine now but planes were the only thing that was added we got cars yeah look at this golden car looking thing oh yeah it can literally drive up mountains this is so awesome what kind of animals are these a peacock a Road Runner oh he's stuck in the engine wait I actually killed it I killed the road a rhino oh yeah protect me oh my God this guy he just vanished in the thin air but to make Minecraft even more realistic we also added more cookies yeah we got nutty cookies raisin cookies cookie blocks and even cookies on a plate and since cookies make me happy let's do a backflip yeah there's a floating elephant this is elephant Jesus bro just walking on water look at that and this is an upgraded deter Temple oh my God it's huge is there also TNT down here hold up oh my God oh my God the entire thing just fell this is the upgraded jungle temple and honestly the one that I built is way better and there's way more traps in here though let's go to the end Dimension it's pretty insane over there so look at this this is insane so every single one of these pillars lights up and kind of blows up it summons the ender dragon all the way up here and honestly they could have upgraded the Ender Dragon but he's the same but yeah Minecraft looks pretty insane with all of these mods installed honestly I'm pretty tempted to start a whole Minecraft series with all of these mods installed but I'm going to give this upgraded Minecraft version an S tier and the final game I'm going to be playing is called flyfly dragon and it's the most expensive which is $260 let's buy it wait what is this buy most expensive games on Steam bundle wait is it cheaper to buy a bundle of 13 games than buying this game itself 95% off which makes $33,000 to $159 you know what I'm buying it all if you guys want to watch me play the most expensive games on Steam let me know in the comments and I'll do that in another video destroy city and gather 100 points to complete the mission oh my God what am I playing there's only four different angles I can choose from this sign right here is blocking from flying I'm a whole dragon and I can't even fly over this small puny dinky sign you know what let me let me blow fire on it yeah take that sign oh I missed it that sound effect was horrendous what is happened there's not even no sound effect for me blowing fire okay why is this K4 sign indestructible you know what let's move on let's take down this building dude this sound effect is so bad what why why is there a human screaming every time I change angles so the entire point of this game is to be a dragon and to burn down the entire city I can't even change my camera angle to see the entire city is there is there anything else I can do oh wait yeah mission complete they didn't even sell a menu right is Manu oh my okay let's go next destroyed the city and gathered 550 points that's literally the same goal and how am I on level 10 now I was just on level one wasn't I oh at least this is a different world oh wait there's the city wait it's the same exact City isn't it oh my yeah I'm going to say it right now this isn't really like Minecraft I I I kind of just wanted to see what $260 would get me it doesn't get much better than this all right I'm going to put flyfly Dragon at an S tier I've never been more happy and satisfied playing a game so thank you guys so much for watching this random video And subscribe and comment down below if you guys want to see me play the most expensive games on Steam all right I'll see you next week love you guys die you human oh he lived and he's moonwalking now"

let's see where I'm going to be landing first Theo's picked fencing Fields Theo's also going to be in control of the color Rarity weapons that I can use in each game I play got five Lego blocks to present every Rarity of weapons let's see what I can use this game green okay that's not bad fun fact I don't even have a rank for build mode so we're going to find that out as well chest in here suon green yeah that works that's green dude I've got so many heals shotgun next would be perfect I got to remember that I'm in builds mode so if you see me forgetting to build I apologize oh shotgun as well hey this is good this is good this is not a bad start at all I'll take it bro that is my kill there's one down see you later buddy I got to prioritize ammo right now two kills to our name not the worst start in the world I will take it lots of action going down I'm pretty sure people are going for the boss here wait that was a grunt no not mean to do that at all swear I just saw someone build over there yeah there we go look oh oh Midas Midas Midas I don't want your Mythic weapon I can't even use it leave me alone don't think this place has been looted this point we could just do with some uh Mobility to be honest with you hold on Wow Slim Shady my friend you need to train a little bit but I am not going to complain what's the method to use in build mode I'm just going to stick with this shotgun can still spam its way through builds which could be quite useful just to prove I am in build mode Let's crank out a quick 90 double edit double edit wao whoo whoo wo wo just trying to show people my builds people what in the lag was that not the easiest weapon to hit with but I quite like the challenge oh no this person's coming for me aren't I can just tell by the way they're moving they want me dead there's also someone with a medallion right on which I just did not clock I literally being chased by this guy with a medallion why is everyone coming for me pretty sure I got more petrol than you mate so good luck trying to outr run me what in the ram you mate oh my God how is this guy still alive get out of here you telling me there's a chance we complete this challenge in build mode there's no way right surely my biggest concern right now is I have one item from ability I know that people in this Lobby have a Grappler so I seriously need one myself oh God I think the grappler guy with the Medallion is coming this way I'm scared there he is run having this guy's car oh my God look at the fewel levels if he's if he clocks this has no fuel I am definitely dead oh was a car ooh someone here what they doing what's their plan absolutely destroyed I need a Grappler maybe I just going to take that guy with the Medallion head on and try and steal his Grappler from him what the what in goodness name is this I forget how random the lower rank games are it's like you could find God's greatest gift to fortnite or someone that doesn't know what they're doing like that person you just don't know oh my God The Medallion guys coming after me wait wait wait wait wait they're fighting oh my God I killed him I did what I said I wanted to do and took that found the guy with the medallions and took his Grappler how have I B this off what is going on I'm the guy to beat something I still don't even know what my rank is yet okay this person's actually [Music] good oh my God Ally this is why I don't play build mode okay oh my God okay it's not a sniper alley you're not going to hit someone that far I think I have every Medallion in the game I genuinely feel like everyone's hiding they're scared of the five Medallion Beast I knew someone would be in a car you can't pretend to be AFK mate come on this is ranked oh my god this is my game surely come on no did the other player just drive into the storm I have no words o go weirdly enough that's actually a better rank than I was given in zero build we have to go on to the next game right away okay this is a good mode for me but where's Theo going to send me let's take a look what's he going to go for oh the train station no what I actually cannot remember the last time I landed here and weapon Rarity what's it going to be please be something good it's definitely not great it is okay someone already being shot here o big damage gone in already there but think he's off yeah he doesn't want any of this he he is not having it oh chest are kind of useless I do spy another gray weapon that is fantastic ooh some frisber come on and a shotgun BR we're pretty much oh my gosh yes and an assault rifle pretty much ready to go I'm going to shove all of this on I reckon and then maybe try and hunt down that guy that we almost eliminated at the beginning I can hear someone mate good attempt good attempt but your non gray weapons are no match for me woo oh my God bro came running at me with his auto shotgun but I am not having it not today my son has sent me a challenge and I am here to make sure that I get it completed no matter how hard it is genuinely not sure if we're going to get much better loot than this for the rest of the game now I did hear someone in a vehicle in this direction ooh okay this guy's not messing around there you go no where are these guys coming from get out of here I'm pretty sure a few of these are Bots but a few of them are 100% aren I want to get into a vehicle I can go ahead and investigate the guy that's in the car and see if we can take him down with a little bit of surprise attack there he goes that's him mate smash him oh you got so lucky woo where is he run I think I freaked myself out there where did he go he's gone he's gone I was definitely perfectly fine but you know when you just get a bit scared I'll find you again later I haven't forgotten about you now do I have the ability to put this on rout getting headshotted by a sniper yes I do beautiful ooh it was close though oh it was really close two people ratting around waiting to shoot me oh my God above I'm dead surely there's no way I get away with that yes I was hoping this car's here my only saving grace to be honest with you I have now no movement no heels I'll pick up another gun because why not what is this load out I'm never killing anyone with this are you serious is should be my strength this mode should be the one that I can win in a lot rides on doing decently in this one but the lobby does seem like kind of stacked low key okay this is really really lucky some movement at least I don't think he's going to stop chasing me I genely don't think he's going to stop chasing me so I got to go weirdly there's a medallion here nope it's bugged I want to get this but also do I get head shot sniped 5 4 3 2 1 somehow pulled it off all right can leave that and come back for it in a bit someone's sniping in that bush I'm going to leave him alone have fun sniping almost done perfect timing Mission failed we'll get him next time what was [Music] that I have my random Duo shout out Manny but where we're going to go let's see what Theo picks ooh the tiger I love mixing up my landing spot and let me tell my teammate actually that we're going to go here and hopefully he follows please jump please jump please jump what about Rarity let's see what's going to be picked here can we get something different blue okay oh no my teammate is coming here nice wait be careful where the heck are you Landing what are you doing we already being shot at this is not good got a sniper I can use oh mate there's someone on me already okay actually something what the hell bro loky in some kind of cracked out Lobby he I'm coming over I don't know who we're against but these guys seem fairly decent what on What on Manny mate I think we're against aimbots come on let's go Manny let's get out of here we're clearly not welcomed here now we got to pray that no one has come over here first which don't think they have fantastic there you go Manny take some of those mate okay Manny mate do you want to heal or you just going to sit in the corner and Crouch maybe he's gone to text his mate that he's playing a aler look I I don't know I don't know I don't want to don't want to put words in his mouth but definitely not here right now I want to get some Revenge at lavish lir I can't lie oh yes okay definitely a better AR I'm going to take that I'm going to hold two ARS don't question it it's all I can do okay no sniper shots left now whoa come over here please please oh my gosh this is so hard thank you mate got some big damage in there oh my God they're still trying to snipe me bro ain't going to leave us alone Manny's got the right idea follow Manny Manny knows best he's the one that's not died yet now can we hire him yes this game may be a little bit slower but you know what I'm having a lot of fun playing with someone else here oh my God just real it's dropped all blue stuff dude this loot cash is literally perfect we got to get some action right let's go towards the railway [Music] oh is that my own MPC doing that bro what are you doing trying to get us [Music] killed who are you throwing it at there's one gone finally hit someone get in a car mate come on yes oh my what was that snipe yes bro I think it's one V one Manny I think it's a oh my God we almost won Manning no now where do I have to land let's take a look what's Theo going to pick what's going to pick yes fencing okay got my favorite Mythic here I love this area but can I actually use the Mythic Theo pick me a color of Weaponry to use no green okay at least it's going to be fairly simple to find green but I can see a lot of green here already I need something green I'm on top of something gray that works that works I can't use that as much as I want to I can hear shooting going on at the edge of the field can I get myself an early kill come on yes there's one he was shooting some right yeah he was oh limited ammo woo I swear I did hear someone yeting behind me as well so got to be careful here first few kills are down they have no Weaponry that I can use so we're just going to have to stick with this assault rifle for now you ever want to mix up the way that you're playing fortnite get your kid to pick how you play and it will definitely mix it up that's for sure I thought getting green stuff would be so much easier than it has been so far luckily you know what I'm missing actually I'm forgetting that in build mode you don't have the overshield the people drop so much quicker and I've got probably my personal favorite spammy shotgun I know it's awful oh my God and an SMG oh what should I use you know I'm going to pop all of these and then take that and I think we're ready to go baby who wants to be shot at there's someone over there I'm sure that is yeah he's just taking someone down maybe even the boss he we're going to have to be a little bit more careful here oh my goodness gracious me bro I can't lie the the lower health is throwing me off massively and kind of scaring me a little bit one here yeah someone's definitely here hiding behind a literal plant pot get out of here get out of here as well I'm On Top what is going going on six eliminations is is build mode the mode that I should be playing I in fact I haven't built one so forget that it's definitely not the mode I should be playing I'm getting overly excited here I'm also just going to send it and put on The Medallion as well because it's right here bro that's the first time anyone's built on me and I've got to remember that that is something that I can do because I am not doing it right now I'm fighting gone over here and you know what I kind of want to get away from fencing remember you can build Ally remember you can build that it's a thing oh my God this SMG is disgusting okay someone's on okay mate there's no what is this what is this scope I picked up I don't know if I like this I don't know if I like this come on Ally you played build mode for half many years before it was added in you can build you can do this you can remember what to do I'll be honest though oh okay I'm sorry for the apping what's this person doing oh that was my wall 6 hp that was all it took oh my God I got so lucky there should get ready to build here dude is literally trying to Ram me must realize he's facing the world's greatest fortnite battle royale Builder watch out mate my builds are incredible oh someone else is shooting him actually F that's got to be a kill I got to go for right oh 100% wa okay so he's got some skills o going to have to come in with the storm though how's he going to deal with that one eh remember to farm as well haven't I oh it's a chicken where are you hiding chicken I don't do any box fight training I don't play any oh my God short of this person knows I'm not the craziest builder in the world but apparently it's enough to scare them off they're gone the gun they're not having any of it car can spawn over here and this person has found himself in a fight oh what I feel like that that just has to be my kill like it just does I cannot believe how many bullets missed him what is this person doing teammate get yeated got the invisibility cloak Ah that's what he used earlier to get away oh mate you're dead see you later perfect I was hoping this would be here give me Flopper are you kidding me not fair healing station is near thank you very much I'm going to beam him with SMG watch this I can't believe that actually worked that was the worst shooting I've ever seen in my life and somehow they were both on one HP going to attempt to make a big play and get all the way to the other side of the Ring just to try and know what the future storm circles will be as long as no one else does this before me we'll fight again later my friend I must know the Storm Circle my new found love for the SMG oh my God it's too good it's actually disgusting better not be someone waiting here for me to put this in done nice there's only six people left and the storm is just to my right even thinking there's nothing to hide behind I can build Aly build something to hide behind and I literally know that if I go and build my base over here I'll be ready for the next Storm Circle that that guy's gone surely I need like one bullet to hit him I swear to God there we go come there's only three players left and some of them are fighting ooh there oh I think someone just fell down what I'm going to do pop this just a little bit ye my way over o someone just got lost in the storm oh there's the last person this could be it Theo you've controlled this game can I make it count one V one good amount of kills to my name worst weapons in the world apparently not helping here going to get in zone and then try to Gat keep this guy a little bit that's his shield gone oh it's not looking good buddy not looking good buddy I feel like I got a box fight this guy at least try and get close to him woo if someone had said to me that your son would control your game and and you'd win in build mode I would not have believed you my Skins are safe the challenge is complete click here to watch another fortnite video I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you on another one

$1100 can you give me perm Dragon this de scam my purchase sperm dragon with my pocket with my dude that's a hard call my guy I mean you got a point right there I mean I yeah for all the people that bought the dragon yeah we know but you get a discounted price because you kind of bought the one Dragon I think that's how it is you kind of bought the first dragon which you can still use you can still use the the dragon that you bought you can still use it that's the classic you can still use it but you have to buy the new dragon for 2,500 or I think you buy I don't know but you can still use

he [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] n [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a this Henry guy just can't seem to catch a break when we last left the blacksmith's son turned KN at the end of the original Kingdom Come Deliverance things were finally starting to look up for him we did a fine job but the sequel in true video game sequel fashion starts by knocking him down a peg or two and dumping him into a new larger open world to regain his dignity one side quest at a time and to be honest that's refreshing if you do not believe me try me [Music] sh the story of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 picks up almost immediately where the first one left off but it's certainly not essential to have played it to follow what's going on thanks to an extended intro that brings you up to speed on the broader Strokes the year is 1403 Henry is a village boy from Bohemia modern day Czech Republic who saw his home burned to the ground due to a Civil War for the crown taken place between two half Brothers he ended up in the service of a frustratingly goodlooking nepo baby sir Hans Capon to try and help out the supporters of the royal brother who isn't going around burning down villages and that plan got a little sidetracked what's the matter females let's go to them it's not exactly a start back from square one though Henry began the first game as the kind of old school RPG protagonist who is really just some random guy with no skills to speak of he could barely hold a sword and The Unforgiven combat really made you feel that until you put in the time to master it but Henry's a seasoned Adventurer now he knows how to read which is practically a superpower in medieval Europe and while you were out partying he studied the blade you are [Music] I [Music] Surrender this is reflected in the changes to combat in kcd2 which the developers described as luring both the skill floor required to play competently and raising the skill cealing for the most devouted Warriors there are only four attack directions now instead of five thrust attacks are no longer a separate attack button and have instead been folded into the combo system for weapons that make sense with them only carriers are a bit easier to pull off and much to my delight blocking can now defend you from multiple attackers as long as they're all in front of you come on there basically whether you mastered kcd 1's combat or not the lower skill requirement at the very beginning models the fact that Henry is simply a better Fighter by now but careful stamina management is still the core of every scrap and button mashing is one of the quickest ways to die I came across plenty of challenging encounters even as someone with more than a 100 hours across two playthroughs in kcd1 it's not as easy to spam your way through them by getting a couple of powerful combo moves down to muscle memory Mercy spare me the world of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is quite a bit larger as well with two distinct maps about the size of the first games that you can travel back and forth between once both are unlocked the terrain feels fairly familiar for the most part we're still in the central Bohemian Woodlands basically just over the hill from where kcd1 left off but the level of detail on the terrain and vegetation is a noticeable step up and better yet it's way more optimized my RTX 4070 super still can't run kcd1 a 6-year-old game on Max settings but what I played of kcd2 rarely had any performance problems you won't the centerpiece of this new world is the city of kenberg which is quite a bit larger denser and more vibrant than anything we saw in kcd1 it's certainly no Paris or Prague but navigating its crowded streets and markets taking shortcuts through back Gardens and admiring its Grand Gothic architecture is a complete change of pace from wandering around muddy Woodland Trails it's big enough to get lost in built on a realistic scale that makes towns and a lot of other RPGs feel like tiny diaramas the side quests I got to play were also very open-ended and complex the most notable example of this was an arc involving two rival sword schools in kuttenberg with the older and more established one who just so happen to support the wrong King trying to force out the newcomers who are loyal to our boy the rightful Heir it fell on my shoulders to steal a ceremonial sword from the established school and display on the walls of the Town Hall which would be seen as an open call for Challengers the quest doesn't much care how you get the sword I took a sneaky approach picking a lock to the guild side entrance but often you'll be able to choose violence or even diplomacy to solve your problems what it does care about is whether or not you got caught carrying out this little false flag operation as it can affect how the tournament between the two schools play out I of course maintain plausible deniability and won the competition for my school but there are a variety of other ways it could have progressed some of which have long-term consequences up daning do look at that Henry remains unbreakable and undefeated another Quest gave me the option of killing or talking my way past some quote unquote Bandits and I was told that if I didn't kill them they might shop up later and present me with new opportunities Lord Von berov sent us to find the Renegades who ambushed some Knights company down by the pond yesterday a couple of them fled and are hiding out here in the Rocks so tell me who you are and what you know about it skills and perks have also been expanded upon and the perks themselves are gen more powerful some of the ones in the first game offered a boon and a penalty which made them feel more like side grades perks in kcd2 are more straightforward upgrades which they should be especially if I'm going to spend my scarce hard one progression points on them almost everything else Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has to offer feels like a careful refinement of its predecessor warhorse isn't Reinventing The Wagon Wheel here diplomacy still takes into account factors like what clothing you have on and how clean you are with a new system of Saved favorite outfits so you can quickly switch between combat gear and something more suited to a Suare but this time there's more emphasis on picking the right thing to say for the situation instead of just the option you have the best stats for Alchemy is back allowing you to craft various potions and concoctions it's been made less fiddly there's a new blacksmith in mini game for forging your own gear and making a bit of coin following in Henry's Father's Footsteps the reading skill has been replaced by scholarship which is gained by reading books and can provide booms like opening up new dialogue options Henry's still crap at reading Latin though and I'm not sure if that could be fixed and in addition to new more diverse move sets for all kinds of melee fighting Henry can finally get his hands on some guns now this is the early 1400s so we're talking about extremely primitive Firearms the kind that had the tendency to blow up right in your hands my leg so don't go expecting to be Med evil John Wick but if you point them in the right direction from close enough range there's really no amount of armor that will save your foes from the blast then you probably want to grab a sword because the remaining foes will not stand and wait for the subjective eternity it takes for you to reload take that in just about every sense Kingdom Come Deliverance to is shapen up as simply a smoother prettier more refined continuation of the things I like to about the original the core mechanics are mostly the same but sharper and with deeper progression the world looks familiar but broader and more grandiose I had two whole days to play it and it felt like far too little when I was first turned loose from the stocks to pick my own path to Glory I felt that tingly feeling you get the first time you play Skyrim or The Witcher 3 of a massive world full of diverse Adventures that aren't just clearing icons off a map I look forward to spending dozens of hours exploring gearing up the authentic medieval weapons and armor and progressing through the improved perk system maybe Hans will stop being a huge bag of dicks too we've got no message no coin nothing but our ragged asses you know anything is theoretically possible I'm just glad I won't have to wait much longer as 2024 comes to a close there is one question on everyone's mind what is the game of the year and I JM we take this award very seriously and this year you're invited to join in on the debate the payoff to our game of the year watch begins on the week of December 16th with our podcast Nintendo voice chat hey what's up super infos Beyond I can see you wielding a buster sword and unlock what you think after playing it where we deliberate and bicker about each console's game of the year it all culminates with the reveal of the big winner on December 20th on our special episode of Games scoop it's been a great year for games already so far lots of great games log on and join us in celebrating this year's best in Gam gaming wo only on [Music] igf Flow even after the positive preview for AOW this summer I found myself wondering if it was a fluke maybe it was just a fun mission maybe obsidian won't be able to keep my interest as more quests are discovered maybe it was just a nice day nope AOW is just a lot of fun coming fresh off of trying out Dragon A's the veil guard I was so happy when I discovered just how evil I could be to people I met along the way right from the start of a vow something Veil guard just didn't fulfill I am ready do it is in the machine right now from the start I had one NPC dropping F bombs because I was going to leave her in prison a short while later ad Dua would try to intimidate me on a bridge only to meet a swift demise I wasn't in the mood for their nonsense I just wanted to be evil and while I could have handled it the nice way sometimes being evil is just more fun another win but who's counting it's not just the fact that you have more Nuance with every conversation it's empowering to craft the kind of hero or villain you want to be sure obsidian has a story to tell but I feel more in control when deciding how these scenarios play out the character customization options will allow you to craft the face of the character you'll build and while you don't see it all that often you can make someone perfectly lovely or someone that looks like they came straight out of that creepy claymation episode of Adventures of Mark Twain try to survive same thing I do every day even the vendors have unique banter I had the chance to meet the ex-husband of another nearby vendor and the two would talk badly about each other because of their failed marriage vendor had a past relationship with my companion Kai and warned him not to cross her again these little beats do a lot to make the world feel like it has a history and you'll uncover more of that as you Adventure I love these dangling threads that are teased throughout the playthrough hopefully I get to tug on some of them and see how deep each story goes Kai I told you not to show your face around here again on the combat front I also immediately noticed improvements especially in the sound Department obsidian clearly spent a lot of time working on the audio and combat flow and it's immediately noticeable the sound spikes are so satisfying to hear when you've stunned an opponent and can execute a Flurry of Blows or bullets or when using stealth and you're able to execute your prey with an ethal blade and one addition we got to see for the first time was the ability to use third person or firstperson combat both feel great and while I personally opted for the firstperson perspective most of the time third person is looking and feeling good too the only slight gripe I have is that the movement can have a bit of that floaty obsidian style to it in third person but that doesn't affect combat all that much who's this watch out and while I'm discussing minor complaints knowing full well that obsidian still has months of Polish time left I did feel that your companion Kai was a bit too handh holdy with his tips at times there were a few moments when I was simply Scavenging for Loot and found him Whispering tips about a puzzle in my ear I think there's something on the Upper Floor we might be able to reach it from outside I know obsidian is trying to help out new players but it takes away from that feeling of accomplishment you get when solving the mystery for yourself Kai I know how to solve the puzzle okay like give me a second you got everything you need to fix up your arm let's head to camp but to get back to the positives loot was also a highlight even early on upgrading from a bow and arrow to an arabus felt awesome and even though I probably said Arbus wrong the trade-off with the rifle is that it has a long reload time but once you've upgraded your abilities with it you'll unlock faster reloads and more damage and the ragd doll physics add to the fun Factor as [Music] well yet again though my time with a vow felt all too short and make no mistake there was plenty to explore in this small area I found a spider cave where I took on a spider boss I found the entire hourlong demo that we had the first time we played AOW and a plethora of small stories within the world like this one guy who happened to be missing a ring and trying to find it and I left wishing that obsidian had given us more time to play but that's a good sign and so far everything seems to be coming together in what I can best describe as a really fun RPG but more importantly it feels like an RPG where I'm in control of my own destiny and while the decisions I making will have consequences I love knowing that I get to be the one directing the orchestra so to speak we'd be most appreciative of course in both of my Hands-On sessions with a vow I've only been able to see the donore section of the map and not much more I do hope there's plenty of content here but I'd really like to see more given how close the February release date is now when I asked obsidian about this they promised several biomes would be explorable and that will no doubt add a lot to the visual diversity of the world I just wish we could get a peek at it beyond the footage from the very first gameplay reveal from many months ago no spoilers on the story here but the one narrative hook that is set up early on is a mission which takes you to The Voice this voice leads you through the map and is clearly an entity you'll hear from again during your adventures when given the chance to help it or refuse to make a deal I decided against siding with a blue light as I've learned nothing good ever comes from a deal with an all powerful entity but I will be curious to see how that plays out in the end the voice did not seem happy see who poisons us we cannot see and that's really the best you can hope for from previews of an RPG like this you get just enough to leave you wanting more and a vow certainly accomplishes just that I want to power up my companion Kai to see what other attacks he can do I want to discover the coveted weapons the design team told us about during the pre Hands-On presentation I want to kill more people and betray my friends and a vow is empowering me to do exactly that maybe I'll let the Virgin live this time uh it's all right I'm I'm sure someone else will give me a hand about is set for a February 18th release date and I can't wait to find out just how evil so contestants are you [Music] [Laughter] ready you coming [Music] these are the times in which Legends are born [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the video game industry is currently in the THS of a paradox for players it could be argued we're in one of the greatest times for gaming there's incredible breadth of choice across consoles handhelds and PCs made ever more accessible through gaming subscription services like Xbox game pass and PlayStation Plus but from an industry perspective things could not not be more dire more and more Studios seem to be closing original IPS are being scrapped mid development and vast Legions of game developers programmers artists and animators have been cut loose to put it simply the AAA video game Bubble has finally burst across the past 2 years over 23,000 jobs in the video game industry were lost with a staggering 6,000 in January 2024 alone over 30 video game development Studios have ceased operations including Arcane Austin volition and most recently fire walk Studios what's worse is this trend only shows signs of continuing rather than diminishing so how did we get here well some analysts have concluded these closures and redundancies are a necessary remedy to companies having overextended themselves in response to inflated demand in the market during the covid-19 pandemic while that's undeniably a factor that's just one of many issues that have been gestating for years within the AAA project bubble just 5 years ago triaa Project's average budget ranged from 50 to $150 million today the minimum average is2 $200 million Call of Duty's new Benchmark is 300 million with Activision admitting in the competition and Market authorities report on AAA development that it now takes the efforts of one and a half Studios just to complete the annual Call of Duty title but it's far from Just Call of Duty facing ballooning costs in the same CMA report an anonymous publisher admits that development costs for one of its franchises reached $660 million with $550 million of marketing costs on top which makes it a $1.2 billion game to put that into perspective Minecraft the world's bestselling video game of all time only broke $3 billion last year and keep in mind that's what it made since it launched way back in 2011 the realities of these budgets mean entire publishing houses are massively overstretched and are now desperately facing the consequences if their developers huge projects don't make money immediately they got to go sega's sci-fi shooter super game hyenas was in development at creative assembly for 7 years and just as it was publicly playable for the first time via Alpha Testing it was promptly cancelled the reason Sega preemptively concluded that couldn't make its money back blizzard survival project Odyssey had a similar trajectory Odyssey would have been the Studio's first new IP in 8 years and given the Market's love for games like Minecraft and rust such a gaming Titan should have undoubtedly made waves with this project when Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard though the project was swiftly killed with little reason publicly given Beyond inconveniences in switching engines to increase player count on the servers these examples of the current AAA publishing call reflect a deep rooted fear to engage with anything new and original Publishers perhaps perhaps more risk averse than ever to stray out of their established IP safety bars but even well-known IP that could be worth millions in sales and revenue is being left to rot despite owning Infamous Jack and Daxter Killzone resistance and Sly Cooper to name a few entries in PlayStation's sprawling dormant Library Sony CFO heroki toi recently claimed the company lacks Enough original Ip to consolidate itself as a true gaming Powerhouse yeah you talking to him what toi May mean is that Sony's older catalog of Library IP he does not fit the mold of what every publisher has been mindlessly chasing for the better part of the decade the next big live service money printer money it's difficult to imagine much fanfare for a Sly Cooper reboot where Bentley and Murray are purchased to play Grand heists or season pass bonuses and worlds are delivered Half Baked instead of fully formed it's undeniable that on some level the video game Market has changed forever because of this live service model new video games don't just have to compete with new Rivals but somehow find space in an increasingly crowded market dominated by decade old titles like fortnite and Grand Theft Auto online games which will continue to hold higher player accounts than many of the best sellers of the last few years but live service titles require investment of not just money but also time to find Their audience neither of which was afforded to firewalk Studios Concord the crew of concord's Northstar will never fly again the recent fate of concord's firewalk Studio serves as a microcosm for the increasingly Bleak outlook for the next few years in video game development Concord was firewalks first game it's baby in many ways an 8year development bolstered by a Sony acquisition and a reported cash injection of $ 200 plus million PlayStation reportedly believed it had the next star wars-esque franchise on its hands but the game struggled significantly across both its beta testing period and launch and was soon completely shut down by Sony just weeks after it was released with firewalk closed for business shortly thereafter concord's downfall happened faster than any other failed game of the live service era don't joke about something like this just a decade earlier though a similar disaster was plaguing Blizzard's Diablo II the crippling error 37 message made the game unplayable and fans worldwide decreed the absolute Failure to Launch soon after the Game's real money Auction House left players with a foul taste in their mouth that Diablo I's reputation was roasting in the fires instead of abandoning it blizzard repaired the game removed the auction house and then fundamentally upgraded and evolved it to Diablo I 2.0 with its Reaper of Souls expansion finally cementing its comeback as a brilliant game it's a similar story to what we saw with CD project Red's hardfought Battle to win cyberpunk 2077 fans back after a disastrous launch if concord's alleged $2 200 plus million do budget had been lowered and the project Direction refocused as a spark for a new universe rather than a big bang it doesn't seem hard to believe that it could have found an audience with some Blizzard or cdpr like shepherding from Sony many projects akin to Concord could be the mediumsized successes they deserve to be if not for the financial Corners these Publishers find themselves painted into endless R and really maybe some Publishers should consider steering clear of these Financial quarters entirely gamers are beginning to WAN interest in these monolith iic projects you need only look at a top rated games of 2024 list while 2023 award lists were littered with AAA titles from 500 strong Studios 2024 show a revitalized hunger for a smaller more independent Spirit arcade machine throwback UFO 50 the Metroid Vania esque animal well poker Rog light batro and text-based pixel art Adventure the crimson diamond are just some of the games you'll see appearing again and again on these lists despite their numerous differences they share one thing in common a smaller more refined experience that recalls earlier eras of Gaming where marriages and mechanics and storytelling were key through technological craftiness rather than literal countrysize game worlds The Nostalgia they create for older video game Generations are Central to the heart of their creation they just want you to pick them up and have a good time the slow but increasingly clear pivot of video game audiences to a potential Indie Renaissance is a clear message to Publishers that if everything is bigger and Bolder who possibly has the time and energy to play more than one or two games each year did I ever tell you the definition of insanity that's not to undercut the difficulty in getting those independent titles made mind you UFO 50's mossmouth LLC team consisted of six developers working over many years while both animal well and the crimson diamond share similar stories of being crafted by solo developers Billy basso and Julia minamata respectively over several years even a Smash Hit like lethal company started Life as a oneman band developer zers learning to develop games on Roblox before expanding his knowledge all of these developers put everything they had over several years of their lives into creating these games not in pursuit of money but because of a passion and this is why they don't need human amongus worlds or 300 plus side quests to tick off these games all feel like lean enjoyment machines it feels like the top end of the video game industry is currently faced with two paths to choose from the first is the status quo it can continue to engorge on bigger budgets with impossibly open yet incredibly empty worlds filled with 80 plus hours of content about 10 of which have any meaning to its players and or hopelessly pursue the live service train which left the station over 5 years ago with late passengers wondering why the money isn't rolling in anymore these billion- dollar gambles could pay off but it's seeming less and less likely every day conversely companies could opt for a second path and take a page out of Julia minamata Billy basso and zeker books a wider breath of projects smaller in scope and scale with a refined focus on gameplay mechanics and perhaps a return to older styles of video games long dormant projects where developers aren't afraid to make weirder choices and take some unexpected left turns less they crash their $400 million ship into a mixed to decent reception and lackluster sales maybe Studios and more importantly Publishers and shareholders can remember that we used to play video games games because they were fun not because of their bigger than last year Maps carpeted by denser higher resolution grass that you walk across to finish another piece of side content that pushes you just one digit closer to that 100% completion this wasn't the plan oh just wasn't the one we started with speaking of which congratulations you've almost 100% at this video what do you think needs changing in the games industry do you want bigger games or more games sound off in the comments below and for everything gaming you are already in the right place IGN [Applause] when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise it's easy to H cast every game is the same big Blockbuster Hollywood action movie where you single-handedly save the world from this year's nuclear threat people like me and Adler are the reason we ain't speaking Russian right now year after year this clearly works for one of the bestselling franchises of all time but the Black Ops series tends to do something a little different from the left trigger right trigger shooting galleries the franchise is known for there's that shooting I remember from the mancherian candidate inspired story of the original Black Ops complete with number of stations and even a hint at who may have actually assassinated JFK tried to make me kill my own President right to the use of project MK Ultra a real life CIA mind control project from the 1960s in Black Ops Cold War and recently Black Ops 6's drug induced survival horror like emergence mission complete with mannequin jump scares and zombie hordes Call of Duty Black Ops utilizes Horror in its games to elevate the story of Black Ops into a mystery spy Thriller that's not afraid to tackle some of the darker events in the cia's [Music] [Applause] history what's a video about Black Operations without talking about one of the strangest and at times scariest real world examples of the cia's desperation to win the Cold War without digging too deep into the rabbit hole MK Ultra was a project run by the CIA from 1953 to 1973 where they helped to develop new forms of interrogation using brainwashing and psychological torture LSD brainwashing and other methods of psychological experimentation were used on thousands of unwilling participants throughout the ' 50s and into the 70s until the project was ultimately ended due to its unethical use of non-consenting participants and Hefty costs a lot of what happened during MK Ultra was lost due to an order from CIA director Richard Helms to destroy all records of the project during a congressional investigation kind of weird timing if you ask me but it did inspire a bunch of movies shows books and video games to try to fill in the gaps thanks to MK Oprah's research we had a backup plan in Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War MK Ultra was the basis for one of the more creative and horrifying levels of the series near the middle of the third act the player character Bell is taken into a CIA black site to be questioned and have their mind broken into once Adler and perform an interal injection of LSD on Bell to kickart his memories and break his mental conditioning the game's psychological horror elements really kick into gear damn through the eye socket you sure about this [Music] doc while only about 30 minutes long the entire scene elevates Black Ops storytelling and production value in more ways than one visually it uses traditional horror movie elements like jump scares and unsettling imagery to give the player a first-person view of the horrors of brainwashing and a deteriorating mind the music is menacing and the sounds of Belle's heart racing are only interrupted by the droning sounds of an old stereo playing at half speed while Adler tries his best to drive through Belle's broken mind B's heart rate is do it now heart rate is spiking I'm not sure how much longer Bel can last this all comes together at the scene's climax providing the impetus for the whole campaign when Belle learns the truth about why this happened and how he became the perfect but unfortunate candidate for Mk Ultra testing the numbers Mason what do they mean where are they bradc don't know anything about any numbers Black Ops 1 is also full of some otherwise horrifying segments that are Amplified due to their real world Inspirations one of the most prominent throughout the series is number stations which were used to relay encrypted messages across one ray Radio [Music] Transmissions 2 5 8 8 0 2 5 8 8 during the Cold War these stations gained prominence and were used frequently by Soviet spies operating Western countries While most number stations are believed to have been nothing more than really secure phone calls it's alleged that some are used to activate sleeper agents once they heard a specific phrase the main character of Black Ops one Alex Mason is one of those agents the subject has been successfully implanted with the knowledge to translates the number sequences throughout the game Alex finds himself in a dimly lit room full of screens with strange numbers flashing on them complete with a disembodied voice leading an interrogation as players progress through the story numbers start to flash on screen as well as events that didn't actually happen like when Mason imagines himself assassinating JFK in a CIA black site and the evolvement of Victor rnof Alex's close friend who revealed to have died years prior even though he shows up in gives Alex life multiple times throughout the story he nearly took a bullet no one fights alone the eeriness of these unexplained numbers and disembodied voices during the early days of the Cold War gives an otherwise standard action game much deeper meaning to its death and its story brainwashing in number stations may not be as traditionally scary as Pyramid Head or Lisa from PT but the idea of a trigger phrase that can make someone unwillingly carry out a task that no matter how unethical or Grizzly it may be is pretty scary and how Black Ops presents this as an analog horror during real world events only elevates a great spy Thriller from summer blockbuster to something that people still talk about almost 15 years after its release why did you have to kill it cuz the numbers were telling me too why don't you [ __ ] understand 2 14 3 [Music] 14 Black Ops 6 is full of disturbing and dark imagery but the mission emergence is by far the most horror heavy Miss mission in the entire Call of Duty franchise you know outside of the zombie mode obviously there we are this mission is a cation of a few different aspects we've covered so far there's mention of MK Ultra programming drug field psychological warfare brainwashing and even zombies prior to this Mission players will have come across notes and audio logs that detail a human experiment involving a set of twins and a mysterious drug called cradle they developed the Cradle a new generation of operatives would be born of it these audio logs hearken back to the research done during MK Ultra and its real life predecessor project artichoke building up for what may be one of the most unique and surreal levels in the entirety of the Call of Duty franchise no one will know this took place you may not even remember much yourself at the start of the emergence Mission you fall deep into an underground research facility run by a shadowy government agency known as Advanced Technologies and applications everything about this level cranks the horr dial up to 11 and the game immediately shifts from its modern military routs to something more akin to Bioshock than Battlefield the ATA facility is full of mysterious and unsettling Illuminati imagery like the Eye of Providence which we've all seen on on things before like Renaissance paintings depicting Jesus Christ the backside of a dollar bill and Freemason iconography it's used here to represent one of the most common depictions of the Eye of Providence the Illuminati while number of stations in MK Ultra have existed at one time the Eye of Providence better known as the allseeing eye has been associated with the agal conspiracy theory of a shadowy one world government that calls a shots with complete jurisdiction and no ethical boundaries by allowing players to explore the abandoned ATA facility to discover its secrets we get to learn more about the cia's ties with the characters in Black Ops and how no matter what they do there's really not much they can do to stop the government from carrying out these experiments on people for the sake of Mind Control emergence raises the bar for Call of Duty's horror storytelling sections by removing the player's usual weapon load out in favor of an Axe and introducing multiple zombie jump scares in the game that has been relatively grounded up until this point [Music] Black Ops 6 is able to lean heavily into the dark and Mysterious World of Black Operations and the more Fantastical side of things with Illuminati imagery and even more references to project MK Ultra after treating us with the Cradle they tried to mold us into the perfect Soldier they plan to Break Down The Walls of Mind and [Music] Body the the series strategic use of horror and its ability to highlight some of the US intelligence community's darkest moments has not only made the Black Op games stand out in a sea of modern advanced and infinite Warfare but also elevated their capacity to tell a thought-provoking and at times terrifying story about the real Things That Go Bump in the night while they may only dive into traditional horror for a few brief moments in each game's campaign the effectiveness and unsettling nature of each Mission along with many other explorations of disturbing topics have proven time and time again that the Black Ops series use of horror has contributed to some of the best campaigns in Call of Duty and Modern military shooters ever whether you adored 2013 Indie darling contrast or were disappointed by 2016's we happy few it's hard to argue that developer compulsion games doesn't swing for the fences and try new things after spending a day with the team taking a closer look at South of midnight it's clear that Innovation streak hasn't slowed down one bit and I went from mild curiosity to full-blown hype for this unique action adventure game though I didn't see anything that blew my socks off in terms of gameplay it stood out in just about every other way especially with its striking setting curious stop motion animation and Stellar original soundtrack that all left me eager to see more and play it for myself you mean to tell me your mama never told you stories about Critters and Weavers oh you're lucky I come along a quick disclaimer before we get started I wasn't provided footage of the hands-off demo shown at compulsion games' office and so won't be able to show you all the things I saw instead I'll be relying on existing publicly available sources and you'll just need to fill in the blanks shaking bones been a while south of midnight is set in a part of the world we don't see too often in games the American Deep South it isn't just a backdrop for you to fight monsters but rather the entire premise on which the adventure sits with characters folklore and mythical creatures all drawn from Real World places and stories during a hands-off demo I saw flooded Wetlands after a recent storm mosquito riddled swamps and ostentatious antibellum manners each infused with elements of fantasy I'd not seen anywhere else these exotic places fit nicely with an equally unusual art style that emulates stop motion animation yet another rare games and one that would be sure to fog up G mod del Toro's glasses the whole thing looks like it was ripped from the pages of a children's story book which I really dug it definitely took some getting used to it first as the jerky movement might easily be mistaken for frame rate wonkiness to the untrained eye but it also adds to the otherworldly fantasy charm that south of midnight oozes it can sometimes be pretty difficult to understand how exactly a game will feel to play during a hands-off demo but in the cas case of south of midnight touching a controller wasn't necessary to recognize its best quality it's [Music] music each level has you facing off against a crypted from Deep South folklore as Southern inspired blues and jazz intensifies and the lyrics help tell the story of whatever Beast you're tracking [Music] down in the case of this demo it was an enormous alligator called two toad Tom based on an actual legendary creature as to toad Tom be at first the music Started slow with a slick Baseline and a choir Whispering totoe [Music] Tom but by the time we unraveled The Mystery of the mythical Gator and progressed to the final confrontation the chorus reached a fevered pitch the words of which told the tale of poor old Tom [Music] all of these components the setting art and music set south of midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it the flip side of that is that what I saw of gameplay offered far less originality combat looked like a pretty by theum System of dodging striking and finishing moves that are quite well trodden and exploration relied on double jumping midair dashing and grapp to distant locations that are pretty standard stuff the boss fight against two-toed Tom for example was a very repetitive process of leaping over telegraphed attacks and wailing on the gator when he presented obvious opportunity to do so compulsion games says that while they expect gameplay to be engaging it isn't nearly as much of a focus as the story music and other elements they've clearly put the line share of work into instead they're keeping levels relatively short for a 10ish hour story and putting all of their chips into south of Midnight's exceptional presentation and World building and so far I'm convinced they just might pull it off after all even without playing it myself it's made a great impression on me here's hoping it delivers when we finally get to play it next year I'll pick you up y after to go find your mom as 2024 comes to a close there is one question on everyone's mind what is the game of the year at IGM we take this award very seriously and this year you're invited to join in on the debate the payoff to our game of the year watch begins on the week of December 16th with our podcast Nintendo voice chat hey what's up super INF friendos Beyond I can see you wielding a buster sword and unlock what you think after playing it where're will deliberate and bicker about each console's game of the year it all culminates with the reveal of the big winner on December 20th on our special episode of Games scoop it's been a great year for games already so far lots of great games log on and join us in celebrating this Year's best in gaming only on IGN right now is probably the best time in a while to be a fan of action RPGs the developers are cooking the gamers are eating it's as simple as that if you're into the arpg genre of top- down monster slaying looter games then you're most certainly bursting at the seams luckily you're primed to loot some new better pants anyways if you aren't playing these games now is the absolute best time to set everything else aside and join the buffet to grind these games down with the rest of us let's talk about three of the biggest best and coolest games in the genre right now and why they each deserve your [Music] time cheers the developers of games like Diablo 4 Path of Exile last Epoch and soon path of Exile 2 are seriously competing in a brutal War for your engagement grinding gear games has been hard at work crafting a fully fledged sequel to Path of Exile a game that's been going strong for more than a decade and even recently hit an all-time Peak not just in concurrent player counts but in the quality of new content as well meanwhile blizzard has spent the last year reacting to critical feedback from its fan base to turn Diablo 4 around and introduce meteor in-game iterations that keep players satisfied and we're not just getting AR RPGs from legendary iconic game studios there's also the newcomer last Epoch from 11th Hour games a studio that built a hit game that was mostly birthed out of a Reddit conversation see about 8 years ago Reddit user MOX jet 200 made a post on the Social Media Forum asking for input from other arpg fans on what features would make for a great entry to the genre that user Jud cobbler is now founder and CEO of 11th Hour games the developers of last Epoch a studio with Talent from all over the world working to keep this game going while there are other notable AR RPGs out there in the wild Diablo V Path of Exile and last Epoch come together to keep us well fed throughout the year with regular seasonal or League content updates oh God Che let's talk about Diablo I a game that managed to have a significant Redemption Arc after many players dismissed it shortly after launch and a few unfavorable seasonal releases when Diablo I first released back in 2023 it felt slow and monster density was about as low as player morale the game quickly came under Fire for its lackluster in-game design especially compared to other args that's been released since Diablo I which effectively altered how players engaged in these types of games blizzard has been quick to react releasing season after season of meaningful content updates that stuck around permanently in the game this feels like a direct result of healthy competition in the genre while grinding gear games implemented new ways to ease the quality of life in the endgame with Settlers of calgar and the introduction of gold and auto mappers blizzard shook up the very fabric of their game to change its Pace the weight of their itemization and overall relevance of content meaningful releases are necessary to maintain players over the course of their Seasons otherwise player numbers dwindle as they have other avenues to satisfy the craving of deleting hordes of monsters on their screen so if you were one of the many action RPG fans let down by Diablo V early on it's definitely worth a second look now Diablo 4 season 5's infernal hordes in-game activity is a perfect example of Blizzard listening to player feedback players ask for Monster density players got monster density jumping into the infernal hordes feels like a complete different game than what we got with Diablo I's vanilla release another clue that competition is key look I get it Diablo I doesn't need to be another Path of Exile with a different skin in fact it shouldn't be however it's refreshing to see that a company the size of Blizzard has been backed so far into a corner that the core gameplay Loop of their game is almost unrecognizable and that's nothing but a good thing for us I've been playing Diablo 4 Seasons longer than I ever have raid likee content check the unders City an infinite grindable activity where you can Target Farm loot check I'm more motivated to chase that next upgrade and actually want to take on the Uber bosses doesn't all feel aimless anymore welcome to Kings March meanwhile path of exile's recent Settlers of calgar released with such high praise from fans that it set a new bar for League content quality you can't help but thank such competition for allowing it to happen the 3.25 update for Path of Exile was timec consuming in the best way possible and surely has to be a response to the growing split attention the fact is is that they are doing more to entice you to play their game they have to be reactive they have to be Innovative and they have to be creative and it's working my jaw legitimately dropped when grinding gear showed off all the quality of life updates and new content during the settlers of calgar reveal live stream what do you mean you can hire NPCs to grind while I grind it was a dream come true for a dream I didn't even know I had there have been nothing but promising updates for Path of Exile 2 and this most recent release for its predecessor gives me nothing but faith in what's waiting for us in the sequel not only will grinding gear games be continually adding content to Path of Exile 2 they will also still support the original Path of Exile with regular leagues as normal they've even alluded to porting back features that they add in Path of Exile too features like gold the currency trade market and more prominent health bars have already been added so not only will grinding gear be in constant competition with other developers they'll also be competing with themselves here Li the answers you seek but what about the little guys 11th Hour games are still here their 1.0 launch for last Epoch was insanely popular with high concurrent counts while last Epoch did suffer from major server and connectivity issues the game was still an excellent grind their monolith endgame mapping system while still a little shallow has so much potential for the addition of depth and player engagement soon after launch last Depo got its 1.1 update harbingers of Ruin sure the update wasn't as massive as something grinding gear games or blizzard could pull off but it shows the dev's commitment to the game that was made by devoted fans of the genre they're a bit silent at the moment on content updates but the imminent release of Path of Exile and Diablo 4's ongoing Seasons likely play a role here as I mentioned they're the little guys they need more time to [Music] cook in grinding gears games's recent Path of Exile 2 live stream they blew the lid off most aspects of the game one of these aspects being their new Atlas mapping in game system which if you peer closely it looks eily similar to last epoch's monolith system an infinite mapping system where if you die you'll be locked out of rewards of course it can be argued that path of exile's delve was the actual inspir Iration for grinding gears games new Atlas iteration but I like the narrative that developers are just sharing ideas now because they love and need our attention anyways you're hungry yet luckily the sweet ambrosial allore of this genre is Hardy enough to keep you well fet when one game is on the downswing but you're still looking to scratch that looting and slaying itch arpg games are a plenty and of excellent quality Diablo games the path of Exiles Grim daon the torch light series Lost Arc the list goes on the genre has never been better than it is now it's a space in gaming where the developers are truly getting the meaning of life service and what it takes to keep players engaged and happy and to that we say keep them coming so contestants are you [Music] [Laughter] ready you coming [Music] these are the times in which Legends are Bor [Music] [Music] n [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as 2024 comes to a close there is one question on everyone's mind what is the game of the year at IGN we take this award very seriously and this year you're invited to join in on the debate the payoff to our game of the year watch begins on the week of December 16th with our podcast Nintendo voice chat hey what's up super in friendos Beyond I can see you wielding a buster sword unlock what you think after playing it where will deliberate and bicker about each con game of the year it all culminates with the reveal of the big winner on December 20th on our special episode of Games scoop it's been a great year for games already so far lots of great games log on and join us in celebrating this year's best in gaming only on [Music] igf over its 30-year history it's fair to say that a lot of incredible games have graced PlayStation across five generations of consoles two handhelds and Toes dipped into the VR Waters there are a lot to choose from but we've put our heads together to narrow it down to the top 100 of all time now what games do you see when you close your eyes and hear the word PlayStation now while we've got a good amount of exclusives on this list we of course have to include a fair few multiplatform Classics as well now our rule of thumb for those is when you think of that game do you see a PlayStation Banner at the top top of its box if so well it qualifies right here now you'll see plenty of familiar faces here from Crash to Kratos but there will no doubt be some that surprise you as well I have an opinion on what should be placed here well let us know in the comments down below so without further Ado here are the top 100 PlayStation games of all time [Music] mascot Platformers were all the rage at the height of the PS1 era and hot on the heels of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro Sony opened a whole barrel of colorful new characters with ape Escape a familyfriendly chimp hunting Adventure that armed players with a slew of monkey capturing gadgets AP Escape was popular enough to spawn many sequels and is still referenced as recently as in 2024's astrobot but perhaps its most important Legacy was being the first game that could only be played with a newly released dual shot controller introducing players to the world of dual analog sticks that would soon become not just the norm for PlayStation devices but the industry standard to this day got [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes greetings greats of this world I come to compete Crash Bandicoot was Sony's answer to Nintendo's Mario so naturally if Mario had a cart racer crash needed one too a Shameless imitation of Mario Kart crash team racing is nonetheless a genuinely fun time with a great selection of tracks and all of the silly weapons and powerups you'd expect from the genre just like his platforming though crash's driving isn't quite on par with his redca Rivals but still CTR is a speedy party in its own right [Music] it's working I've got a dragon wa rough Landing ripto's rage is the most complete Spyro package more challenging than its predecessor it improved on everything that everyone's favorite little purple dragon brought to the table the first time around a certain Bandicoot may have ultimately come out on top as the original PlayStation's most beloved platforming master Scott he was after all the guy in the suit who showed up in PlayStation commercials but Spyro certainly played his part it's also notable and worth celebrating that both Spyro developer Insomniac and crash Studio naughty dog have together evolved into two of Sony's most important sources of Blockbuster creativity from such humble and similar Beginnings impressive most impressive please take this sacred uh thing theama as a token of our Everlasting gratitude [Music] jumping ahead a few console generations and taking a smaller detour Little Big Planet developer medium molecule reinvented its arts and crafts approach for portable gaming with terway one of the PSVita shining stars truly showcasing The Versatile little handheld's capabilities terway made Innovative use of the console's rear touchpad and front-facing camera letting you enter tera's papercraft World by pushing your fingers through the landscape or by having your own mug Adorn the skies as a big Coss shining Sun but even without all the clever gimmicks and set dressing terway is still at its core just a great Charming [Music] platformer come on CT you got to put this [Music] together death Loop was an exciting and stylish new property from Arcane Leon the studio behind the Dishonored series Microsoft acquired arcane's parent company shortly before death Loop's release but the game still released as a timed exclusive for the PS5 and it was a good one echoing the outside the box creativity of Sony's best output death Loop is a Time looping shooter that is also a detective game and a PVP assassination Sim it's ambitious but never to a fa I want you to remember why you came here I want information where the hell am I it's a little ironic that most of the Beloved PlayStation properties mentioned so far have since been acquired by Microsoft but that is not the case for Jack and Daxter Who Remain some of Sony's most beloved characters Rockstar may have dominated the PS2 era of open world games but that didn't stop naughty dog from trying its hand as well Jack 2 moved away from the mascot platform of Bedrock of its predecessor to take Jack and His otel companion Daxter to a hub world city filled with danger an ambitious pivot to a more combat heavy focus it was a gamble that paid off as well as being one of the best looking games of its generation I think the baron set me up actually I think everybody's trying to kill [Music] me another colorful handheld platformer loor roko is one of the PlayStation Portable must own games and one of the many examples of the out there creativity that Sony's Japan Studio contributed to PlayStation since the very beginning relatively simple concept based around the idea of rolling colorful jellies from point A to point B it contained hidden complexities that accentuated its elegant design packed full of charm that threatened to burst out of its portable confines it was a treat in every sense of the word [Music] let we're doing it another beloved Sony Duo dating back to the PS2 era Ratchet and Clank made their PlayStation 5 debut with Rift apart which is arguably still the greatest display of the Hardware's power to date colors pop off the screen at each turn and particles flood the sky at every opportunity especially when firing one of the many outrageous esoteric weapons the series and developer has become known for the incredible visuals are augmented by Insomniac games making full use of the ps5s 3D audio capabilities the Dual sense controllers hap dicks and adaptive triggers and truly showcasing how the nextg Hardware's infinalon platforming to a multiversal scale considering how much of a sensory overload Rift apart was on a launch PS5 it's not a surprise to see Sony using it to test drive the upgraded PS5 Pro can't anyone print instruction manuals anymore [Music] before Reinventing the tetraamino and Tetris effect designer tetsuya mizuguchi had an idea that combined block-based puzzling with electronic music that could be played on the go that idea became illuminous one of the best puzzle games to ever grace the PSP while solving its tetris-like puzzles was what made it fun the kicking soundtrack that synchronized its beat to the gameplay made it so that anyone who played luminous felt like a third member of deft Punk [Music] when does the operation begin our intelligence within the FBI was not clear but rumor's men are already inside the subway it's easy to write off siphon filter as a metal gear clone especially when it was released just months after kima's PS1 Masterpiece but despite the similarities between these two stealth experiences siphon filter is a brilliant Espionage Adventure in its own right thanks to Sharp Gunplay a story stuffed with twists and missions that just as varied as they are action-packed now I will show you how I deal with informance look at this place it's amazing so this is your world the PlayStation 3 library is loaded with Gorgeous games but nuni Wrath of the White Witch is the only one that comes close to feeling like a playable Studio gibl Movie developed in collaboration with that legendary Anime Studio level five delivered a lavish RPG with a Pokémon likee monster collecting battle system that told an enrapturing story about a boy whisked away to a fantasy land to revive his recently deceased mother while the Stellar art Direction shines moment to moment it's the sequences produced by the animation studio that gave us princess monoke and Spirited Away that truly make this one of the most visually arresting games on the PS3 though the PS3 was lacking in top tier RPGs for much of its lifetime Wrath of the White Witch is one very notable exception if all that wasn't enough it also gave us the Welsh legend that is Mr drippy long live our short King you must be the one we fairies call the pure hearted [Music] one proevolution soccer 6 is as good as football games have ever been at a time when the Rivalry between proevo and FIFA was at an all-time high Konami soccer simulation was the sports game to play on PS2 it's the sort of standout opposition that EA sorely misses now as with no strong competition the genre is left to wallow in mediocrity oh for those Glory Days to return [Music] at the mere mention of the game it's likely paton's infectious soundtrack is now playing in your head if you were never hooked patapon was a PSP game that marched to the beat of its own drum quite literally gameplay was a unique blend of Rhythm and strategy because every note you hit in this case a different beat to an actual drum issued commands to a band of oneeyed Warriors you led into battle each game had its charm but patapon 3 refined what made the first two games click while adding new features like multi-level dungeons versus mode races and [Music] battles Untamed Majestic but leful if you hunt these Wilds no matter how skilled you are no matter how clever you will become the hunted Hill Zone developer Gorilla Games took a big swing on the PS4 ditching its desaturated shooter series for the altogether much more vibrant world of horizon zero Dawn it's rug pulling sci-fi story is a solid backdrop for the introduction of a new PlayStation hero in the form of aloy and her metal dinosaur decapitating archery combat The Horizon series seems cursed with the first and second games launching in the same week as The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild and Elden ring and even the first games PS5 remaster shared a release date with Dragon Age The Veil guard still Horizon has persevered against some very stiff competition and zerod daon has already seen a PS5 sequel VR experience and Lego game spawn for it so something tells us we're going to be seeing a lot more of aloy and you will crush our enemies and cast down those who lead us astray PlayStation isn't exactly the natural home of the first person shooter so not too many made this list but it shouldn't come as a surprise that Doom Eternal is one of them after the 2016 reboot ripped and tore the Doom franchise back into the mainstream after a 12-year Hiatus its sof's follow-up refined the experience in a way that made it feel like the shooter of tomorrow instead of the seventh sequel in a decades old series the consequences of your actions here welcome to SSX tricky go SSX tricky proved stiff competition in the extreme sports market for Tony Hawks Pro Skater barreling down perilous mountains and flipping around in every direction was fun in its own right but it's tricky's colorful style that made the otherwise Snow White Vistas truly pop off the screen the ps2's abundance of BMX surfing and skateboarding titles made for some tough to rock around but SSX tricky stuck The Landing I am unbelievable two times multip sometimes it's so easy being me long associated with the Game Boy where Tetris was sold as a bundled game Tetris effect saw re Mastermind tsia naguchi reimagine the Eternal puzzle game for the PlayStation VR headset themed around the psychological effect of the same name that occurs when playing the block stacker for long hours Tetris effect transformed the classic game into a psychedelic trip by combining the Timeless tetraminos with far out visuals and a stellar soundtrack a VR Tetris game could have been the most phone in shovelware imaginable but Tetris effect elevated it to a practically religious experience [Music] Mickey Mouse fused with Final Fantasy shouldn't work but with Kingdom Hearts Square Enix proved that it can't flam's goofy I'm Sora I'll go with you guys however it's in the sequel where the concept truly began to flourish Sora Goofy and Donald and the whole gang embark on a convoluted Adventure through beloved Disney Worlds with particular highlights including the Steamboat Willie inspired Timeless River level Hercules Olympus Coliseum and on space paranoids does it all make sense that's a question for another day we'll enjoy any game that lets us chat with Winnie the Pooh in between bashing enemies with a giant Keo okay guess it's about time to be moving [Music] on the monster hunter franchise is fondly remembered for its PSP Legacy which enabled millions of Gamers mostly in Japan to spend hours hunting and Gathering ing together in between work and school but Monster Hunter world's arrival on PlayStation 4 marked a new age for the series and became the destination for millions of fans new and old from around the globe with enormous monsters to take down and sprawling new areas to explore and even more players to join the hunt monster hunter World takes the series tried and true gameplay Loop and makes everything much much bigger [Music] the original 1999 Medal of Honor co-created by Steven Spielberg was a true PlayStation classic however its 2002's medal of honor front line on PS2 where the historical shooter series finally fulfilled its lofty Ambitions of making Saving Private Ryan's most iconic scene playable opening on an intense Recreation of the D-Day Landings frontline's exciting and varied campaign would prove to be the blueprint for Call of Duty's later success we're placing you on a special Mission good luck [Music] Patterson it's hard to think of many games that are more perfectly suited to the PlayStation vaita than Hotline Miami a top- down violence simulator that's fast frantic and Relentless with murder hotline Miami's secret is its addictive Simplicity and even though it came to other platforms its bite-size levels and Rapid restarts are perfectly suited to the take it everywhere PlayStation vaita it's so good that it even featured as a cameo being played on the vaita no less in one of PlayStation's biggest games ever The Last of Us Part Two yeah they want to buckle up here we go Killzone may have never proved to be Sony's Halo killer but its industrial weight shooting and grimy aesthetic were instrumental in putting Horizon's developer gorilla on the map Killzone 2 is particularly memorable for being a graphical showcase to a controversial degree an early E3 demo may have been too good to be true but the final game was nonetheless a stunning example of the Cinematic visuals the PS3 was capable of [Music] [Music] Square enix's vision for remaking Final Fantasy 7 became crystal clear with its second installment untethered from the need to set up the familiar events of Final Fantasy 7 rebirth is able to throw our beloved Heroes into a vibrant open world that brings to life what every gamer who played the original Final Fantasy 7 was only able to imagine previously bursting at the seams with love for its iconic characters in World rebirth is an ambitious second act in this three-part remake that's already proving as essential as its blocky PS1 predecessor the big question is how long will we have to wait for the final installment but in reality it's barely hanging on the words Ridge Racer are now best known for being shouted by an exuberant Karai at e306 AG racer remember that one all right so let me uh let me go right ahead but years before that it was PlayStation's standout driving game type four hit a sweet spot between the Sim trappings of Gran Turismo and the White Knuckle speed of Wipeout carving out its own Corner as one of the most popular games on the original Sony console [Applause] [Music] before returnal house

where he goes that is of course assuming you could actually get past its initial notoriously difficult driving test a fish barrier to entry before tearing up the streets of Miami and Beyond [Applause] the hunt for a family-friendly PlayStation mascot is as old as the brand name itself but it's fair to say that 2008's Little Big Planet delivered the hero the OTS were looking for with Sack Boy Little Big Planet was not only the birth of a mascot though it was also PlayStation's first significant experiment in user generated content giving players the tools to share their woolly 2D creations with the world developer media molecule would unquestionably do it a whole lot better with sequels and spiritual success or dreams but none of that happens without The Whimsy charm and just plain adorableness of Little Big [Music] PL the yakaza series now known as like a dragon has been a PlayStation staple since the first entry's release in 2005 steadily growing over the years from Niche interest to a cult phenomenon our pick of the bunch is 2015's Yakuza zero in part because its prequel status makes it an easy entry point for newcomers but most importantly is because it has everything you'd want from one of ryugoku Studios crime epics over the- toop action melodramatic CU and majima plot lines and of course life-c consuming mini games including a full Cabaret Club

the foundations of the arcadey top down twin stick shooter that launched on PS3 PS4 and vaita way back in 2015 Arrowhead sequel expanded and augmented every aspect of the game especially the Starship Troopers flavored brand of propaganda satire you will never destroy our way of life the end result was a delightful PVE experience that became a massive team effort with players doing their part to

peaked with 1999 Soul Reaver on the PS1 Crystal dynamic introduced players to vampire ghost protagonist Raziel whose supernatural abilities were put to the test with a combination of combat and puzzles that were equal parts stylish and challenging it was incidentally the first game directed by Amy henig who would then go on to help shape naughty dog in the modern PlayStation Behemoth it is today all the aspects of what has become Sony's trademark single player Formula can be felt way back here in Soul Reaver what pitiful form is this that I have come to inhabit d death would be a release next to this travesty do you think I felt regret as I gazed upon the destruction we have rought or at least humility at the speed with which a world can be transformed from a good work into a hell Prince of Persia the Sands of times chronology warping mechanics were incredibly novel back in 2003 helping cement it as an instant PS2 classic and signaling return to popularity for a series that had been left in the 2D era but while SS of time Supernatural approach formed the Bedrock of a fantastic action adventure the game as a whole is more significant for being the foundation of ubisoft's modern-day success while Sans of time received a number of direct follow-ups ideas for a proposed Prince of Persia sequel would eventually morph into what would soon become ub's Flagship

through but while those long development Cycles have their benefits Jimmy Hopkins Miss Adventures through a year at Bull North Academy are a prime example of when the GTA developer would take risks on smaller projects that offered unusual spins on the Studio's trademark humor and Larger than Life characters Hit Me With Your Best job rumors of a sequel have always persisted and we certainly wouldn't

cool artsy kids favorite PlayStation 2 game before the need to roll up famous IP and turn them into AAA Blockbuster Games The Prince of all Cosmos was rolling up everyday objects into a larger and larger ball and taking over the gaming world with it Katamari deashi is emblematic of the kind of MadCat video game ideas that we don't really see from big studios these days but were a regular

wild combination of lightning quick combat and Demon slaying story conjured up out of 700-year-old Italian poetry was originally planned as an entry into the Resident Evil series before Capcom realized it might have been a little too out there and just made it its own thing instead one of history's most iconic action series it effectively created the character action genre the original DMC has spawned multiple sequels but none have made as big of an impact as Dante's first outing sword time to go to work guys what you doing look around you this is your family oh my God one of the great gaming tragedies is that Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain is likely hideo kima's last metal gear game game ever but what a game to go out on though it was the series first fora into an open world the phantom pain integrated almost all the core mechanics from the previous games refined into their most advanced evolved iteration fire though the Phantom Pain's trouble development begins to show in its later missions the momentto moment gameplay truly feels like the perfected final form of the Tactical Espionage action kajima pioneered way back on the original PlayStation the only language left to me Revenge soccer with cars possibly the most chocolate and peanut butter combination the games industry has seen since Mario with carts rocket League might not be the hited as today without its success on PlayStation Plus rocket league is fun as hell but it could have very well been sted on entirely if not for the huge influx of ps+ subscribers who test drove it for free and presumably told their friends while rocket League arrived on the PS4 back in 2015 it gained and maintained enough momentum to attract the attention of Epic Games who acquired developer psionics 4 years later and

with PlayStation for its ambitious MMO shooter Destiny while it may have been multiplatform Destiny's timed exclusive content drops on PS4 including an all-important alpha test made it feel like an exciting Sony experiment the original Destiny is flawed but it was the lab where Vault of Glass was born The Raid that set Bungie on the path towards both with Destiny 2 and its wobbly multiplayer Crown the darkness is coming back we will not survive it this [Music] time kick punch it's all in the mind those seven words have lived rentree in the heads of an entire generation of Gamers for almost three decades PaRappa the Rapper was a huge part of PlayStation's push for experimentation in the PS1 era and again something we just don't see enough of these days from Big Publishers he might

for today you are agent 47 the world's finest professional Hitman Metal Gear Solid may be considered the definitive PlayStation stealth series but iio interactives Hitman has a strong Legacy dating back to the PS2 era and hey if we're paying more attention to snake maybe that means Agent 47 is actually stealthier but either way it deserves recognition now we could have picked any of the Silent Assassin contracts or blood money for this list but instead we've opted for the much more recent world of assassination the now combined Trilogy of games that acts as the mination of over a decade of playful stealth Mastery io's huge opportunity field levels act as immersive Clockwork murder playgrounds these scripted objectives always allow for amusingly Creative kills but it's the death scenarios you come up with yourself that always prove the most rewarding and The Gallows humor is always to die for hidden in plain sight you are the Ultimate Weapon I want food that don't make me sick I want walls that hold back the wind I want a decent life a PS4 launch game Black Flag showed how transformative the eighth generation of consoles could be for the Assassin's Creed series now while the PS3 version was still able to render the huge nearly seamless Caribbean map the PS4 build did all that with much more detail resulting in beautiful ocean waves and Lush vegetation arguably the best assassins game to date its ambitious Land and Sea open world lay the groundwork for the Beloved Assassin's Creed Odyssey while its environmental detail was echoed at smaller denser scale in cult favorite Assassin's Creed unity all things considered I think it's turned out to be a rather fortuitous day hasn't [Music] it what a pleasant surprise brother save it you're no brother of mine don't say you've forgotten me snake after the success of the first Metal Gear Solid expectations for hideo kojima's PS2 follow-up were immense but rather than merely give fans a better version of what they got in the first game gojima trusted his vision and gave us well something different though he made some divisive choices like sidelining hero Solid Snake in favor of newcomer Ryden coima definitely delivered on bringing Metal Gear Solid to the next generation of PlayStation the visual and mechanical improvements between the first and second game were the kind of massive leap we just don't see much anymore and Metal Gear Solid 2 employed a number of systems and features that have since become commonplace in stealth Action games as for the story say what you will but there's no denying that Metal Gear Solid 2's commentary on the information age and AI was way ahead of its time and is shockingly relevant even today Legend a legend is nothing but fiction someone tells it someone else remembers everybody passes it [Music] on the PS3 was the major starting point for online multiplayer on PlayStation and while there are many examples of great PVP games from that generation that game company's Journey was easily the most Innovative and Whimsical way of showing how connections can form between players a completely rless Adventure players would encounter a

shared experience [Music] back in 1996 an orange marsupio spun his way into our hearts when Crash Bandicoot arrived on the original PlayStation courtesy of a little studio called Naughty Dog initially earmarked to be Sony's answer to Mario and Sonic crash has long since formed his very own identity of Tom Foolery and wper fruit Obsession he can still be seen regularly smashing through crates and setting off TNT boxes to this very day but even though the lovable Bandicoot has since appeared appeared on the majority of video game platforms and is now technically the intellectual property of

as it was for Revenge I'm ready I'm going we end this [Music] together despite many considering it to be one of the best in the series Final Fantasy 9 is often overshadowed as a PlayStation classic by its older siblings it also didn't help that it arrived right at the tail end of the console's lifespan falling to the Wayside when the PlayStation 2 and Final Fantasy 10 were on the horizon but this welcome return to the series original High fantasy storytelling demands your respect a tale of political turmoil seen Through The Eyes of a thief called zidane its clever evolution of Siri Staples and ability to tell multiple concurrent powerful stories truly places it shoulder-to-shoulder with the genres Giants it's arguably one of the strongest RPGs for the original PlayStation and without question the console's last big [Music] [Applause] harah how does it feel Wayne to stand on the very stones that ran with your paren blood 2009's Batman Arkham Asylum was a surprise hit with its

video game [Music] storytelling Square had already enjoyed an incredible run of genre defining RPGs on the original PlayStation but vagrant stories Adventure through bindia captured the hearts and minds of anyone who walked in the shoes of Ashley Riot our hero who is accus of a murder they didn't commit perhaps the biggest crime of all though is that we never got a sequel we can fight this

hard to even articulate how hugely influential Grand Theft Auto 3 was on vium without Rockstar's original satire of New York City the open world genre today simply wouldn't exist GTA 3 catapulted the previously top down Grand Theft Auto series into a 3D world that felt genuinely alive its streets packed with Unforgettable characters and underpinned by a mob movie in inspired narrative that was as funny as it was compelling throwing an unparalleled level of Freedom allowing players to tackle missions in different orders and different ways plus the ability to steal any car you saw in GTA 3's Liberty City started a legacy that is still going strong over 20 years later [Music] [Applause] [Music] as part of the burgeoning relationship between Final Fantasy and Playstation series Creator honobu sakaguchi conceived of a tactical spin-off for Final Fantasy combining his beloved role-playing series with a more strategic genre he loved the result was Final Fantasy Tactics a beautiful and thoughtful tactical RPG for sure but it also introduced the world of eies the land which would go on to become the setting for games like vagrant story and Final Fantasy X [Music] a grimy fantasy dungeon Delver thick with mystery and lore demon Soul's place in the halls of PlayStation history is secure thanks to being the starting point of from software's Modern Legacy it was the journey where we first rested at bonfires to restore our health summoned unknown strangers to Aid Us in difficult boss battles and fought tooth and nail to retrieve our Lost Souls demon souls laid the foundation for bigger and better games but that shouldn't detract from its own achievements particularly its evocative environmental design thankfully it's all been painstakingly restored and handsomely preserved in Blue Points fantastic PS5 remake [Music] the PS2 era God of War was a completely different proposition to its character Focus modern reinvention but what 2007's God of War II may have lacked in Nuance it made up for in scale ferocity and excess chaining together combos with the blades of Olympus Never Felt So Good as ancient Greece's Gods fell at kratos's sandal feet initially created as a western answer to a genre popularized by Japanese developers with this sequel God of War secured its place in the Pantheon of Great Character action [Music] games Chrono Trigger is widely regarded as one of the greatest RPGs ever made but its sequel is equally deserving of Praise rather than simply rehash ideas chronocross89 discover but more importantly its battle system is completely overhauled mixing real time and turn-based strategy to create one of the deepest most fulfilling RPG experiences of its [Music] time the beauty of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker is how hideo kajima really emphasized the portable in PlayStation Portable taking the stealth action gameplay the series is known for Peace Walker delivered bite-sized missions for Big Boss to take on that could be finished in a single commute to worker school not only that but the big story implications set up in peace Walker makes this PSP outing a genuinely important part of the metal gear [Music] storyline picking a favorite Guitar Hero game is difficult because ultimately it comes down to which ER span set list of rock songs you most prefer to pretend you were performing in front of 20,000 people sure Guitar Hero 2 had War Pigs and Freebird but three had a killer Edition that would become synonymous with the series Dragon forces Through the Fire and Flames it's impossible to overstate just how much of a phenomenon on Guitar Hero and its competitor rock band were during the PS3 era but just take a look at how many played to death plastic guitars you'll find at your local landfill and you'll get a pretty good idea go on head over to the dump I'll wait [Music] few games Define the original PlayStation's cultural identity as perfectly as Wipeout it's futuristic heavily stylized aesthetic and techno soundtrack were the epitome of Sony's vision for PlayStation being a lifestyle rather than just another games console but beneath the Slick visuals was a blisteringly fast racing game that thanks to its anti-gravity Vehicles felt completely different from anything that had come before and everything that made the original wipe out great is on Full display in its successor Wipeout 2097 you go after them I'll hold them off here hey yeah good luck [Music] thanks when it comes to the history of console multiplayer Tales of golden eye on N64 and Halo on Xbox dominate the split screen conversation but PlayStation had its own FPS King that deserves just as much respect time Splitters 2o this was the essential PS2 shooter and almost certainly the reason anyone owned the four-player multi-tap peripheral its arcade mode provided match after match of exciting showdowns made all the more thrilling and esoteric by the maps and the weapons that were pulled from a whole host of different time periods and genres [Music] [Music] BT got you the original Titanfall was an XBox exclusive without a campaign when its sequel arrived on the PS4 with one of the finest set of firstperson shooter single player missions ever constructed the series full potential was finally realized toss in an exhilarating and criminally underplayed multiplayer mode to the mix and Titanfall 2 is not just one of the best Shooters to appear on a PlayStation console but one of the best FPS games of all time and of course because we can't have nice things we're still waiting on Titanfall 3 what are you doing trust [Music] me look Sunny we were set up the deal was an ambush after an 11year En counting wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 to arrive the thought of a Grand Theft Auto sequel coming only one year after its predecessor is unimaginable but it happened back in 2002 with fan favorite Grand Theft Auto Vice City promptly arriving 12 months after GTA 3 and it wasn't a quick and dirty spin-off either or a half-baked expansion pack Vice City was a Triumph that took everything its predecessor had to offer and improved it the characters were better the storytelling stronger and the decision to create an 80 set o to Scarface set in a fictionalized Miami was inspired opening the doors for an incredible soundtrack and exciting visual flare Grand Theft Auto 3 may have laid the foundation but Vice City coated it with irresistible style and a whole lot of a neon that's a good idea that's a great [Music] idea it may have taken nearly 30 years but Sony finally made a mascot platformer to rival the likes of Nintendo's Mario it's the most recent game on this list but it's there for a reason astrobot is a consistently inventive joy ride through PlayStation history paying homage to dozens of other games on this list even if you don't have five console Generations worth of nostalgia for PlayStation it's a joy beautiful audio visual showcase that fully Embraces the quirks of the ps5s Dual sense controller instantly one of the console's best games its Legacy will surely only grow over [Music] time there would be no Uncharted without Tomb Raider in fact it's hard to imagine what action adventure games would look like without L's first outing hitting the PlayStation in 1996 it's often considered the first game to approach storytelling in a truly cinematic manner an Outlook Sony would adopt for decades to come it may be a little unwieldy to play at this point in time but there's no denying the original tomb Raiders impact so are you ready to seek your fortune speaking of Uncharted Uncharted 4 a thief's end saw Nathan Drake contending with the prospect of retirement attempting and then failing Miser to resist the call of Adventure an odyssey into not just the darkest dungeons but also the minds and fraying relationships of its lead characters Uncharted 4 was as human as Drake has ever appeared and a reflection of the evolution of naughty dog as a studio that didn't stop it from doing what the series is best known for though delivering Blockbuster bursts of action the Madagascar Chase sequence still Reigns as one of the most dynamic sequences ever experienced through a dual shot controller this Bittersweet closing chapter serves as the perfect ending for one of PlayStation's most beloved series at least for now is going to be close it's that all you've got little Android in order to fully uncover the secrets of the wild ride that is 2017's near aoma you'll need to play through it three times that would seem like a chore for most games but Platinum games' one-of-a-kind exercise in narrative structure makes that Journey thrilling from start to finish tasked with saving a post-war planet from machine forces it's as dynamic as it is compelling packed start to finish with varied gameplay approaches that range from third person hack and slash action to top- down bullet held battles it's exactly the sort of exciting experiment synonymous with the PS1 era making near automa a perfect fit for this list it was an honor to fight with you truly [Applause] [Music] crash bang wallow Criterion for Out 3 take down looked at what pfy was doing with simulation racing in Gran Turismo and took things as far to the other side of the spectrum as possible with just as much emphasis placed on ramming into your Rivals as speeding past them driving games have really been as fun as they were in takedown on the PS2 and that's without even mentioning crash mode an altimer of a mode designed around creating the biggest recks possible [Music] you cover your face but I know who you are Emily calwin if Clockwork like intricacy and artistic Elegance is what you're searching for in a game then look no further than arcane's beautiful Supernatural assassin Sim Dishonored 2 this PlayStation friendly gateway to the player-driven ideals of early 2000s PC gaming is packed with wickedly Smart Level design in which targets can be attacked and approached in any way you see fit going stealthy or stabby is just the first choice and Dishonored to's World reacts appropriately to every single decision you make while [Music] playing there's a reason why Clover Studio is remembered so fondly even decades after it was disbanded the Capcom subsidiary behind games like Beautiful Joe and godand created some of the most wildly creative and beautiful games for the PlayStation but none of its titles are quite so beloved as Okami the cell-shaded art style that renders mythological Japan will be forever beautiful and the iconic paintbrush mechanic that brings brush Strokes to life still feels like pure magic we miss you everyday Clover Studio [Music] although Tony Hawk's Pro Skater made an important mark on Playstation it's the sequel that took the series to the next level birthing the generation of extreme sports video games that followed where Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 excels is its ability to push Beyond being an excellent sports game it established a reasonably complex formula of combos puzzles and collectibles all wrapped up within a 2minute time constraint it demands to be endlessly replayed and when you're doing that in some of the most iconic locations ever committed to a sports game it's hard to resist Tony Hawk Pro sker 2 vitally helped extend the combo by adding in the frankly essential manual system incorporating some vastly improved level design and including one of the most iconic game soundtracks all of which helped cement its Legacy as an extremely good extreme sports [Music] game listen to my story this may be our last chance Final Fantasy 10 is perhaps the best example of how the ps2's DVD drive revolutionized console gaming thanks to the disc's vastly higher storage capacity Final Fantasy 10 was able to be both the First full 3d and fully voiced game in the series resulting in an experience notably more cinematic than its PS1 predecessors combined with dozens of beautifully rendered cutscenes Final Fantasy 10 story is granted an enhanced level of emotion and intimacy a vital thing considering the romance between characters Titus and Yuna that acts as the game's Soulful heart this along with Rock Solid turn-based combat and a bright fascinating world makes titus's Journey arguably the last truly essential Final Fantasy game and that's no laughing [Music] matter it's no surprise Nintendo was the dominant console for jrpgs during the early 90s but when PlayStation launched the landscape changed dramatically this was in part due to Square's Final Fantasy and Chrono series coming to Sony's console but also konami's beloved Soden games their storytelling especially in suen 2 was a notable highlight filled with depth emotion and character so wonderfully realized you couldn't help but fall in love with them it's those connections that make Su and 2 as fondly remembered today as it was 25 years ago what is this wow what a mansion it's hard to imagine what video game horror would look like without the arrival of Resident Evil the first in the long running and extremely successful series debuted on Playstation in 1996 letting players explore the zombie infested puzzle fielded Spencer Mansion although primitive by today's standards Resident Evil set the mold for everything that followed the isolation the limited resources the Relentless sense of dread and of course jump scares the formula has been regularly improved upon and the original is arguably weaker than most of its sequels but none of raccoon City's later highs would have been possible without the progenitor its importance to the genre and Playstation is [Music] unquestionable no one wants to admit it but humanity is under attack Mass Effect 2's achievements are well known with its s tier companions an unrivaled sense of urgency in its story and reactive decision-making its bioware's finest Hour less documented though is Mass Effect 2's journey to PlayStation during which the series Broke Free from the shackles of Microsoft exclusivity a year after the game's launch on Xbox 360 PS3 players were asked to jump into the middle chapter of a Trilogy without having played its predecessor using an interactive comic to catch up on the story it was an awkward transition but one players happily endured in order to play one of the best RPGs ever made both Street Fighter and Mortal Combat dominated the fighting game space in the 90s but neither was synonymous with the PlayStation brand in quite the same way as Tekken the new upand comer that along with virtu fighter established and cemented the 3D fighter there are many contenders for the best Tekken game on PlayStation and we'd especially like to shout out PlayStation 2's launch game Tekken Tag Tournament but for our money Tekken 3 the first outing for legendary characters like jyn Kazama and Eddie Gordo will always stand tall as the true king of the Iron Fist tournament round one fight well I recognize that Dar expression anywhere it was no easy task for Sony Santa Monica to follow up its 2018 North Masterpiece but with God of War Ragnarok it succeeded to Almighty effect while not telling as tight a story The sprawling PS5 sequel evolved kratos's bone crushing combat even further adding a creative new weapon to his Arsenal that reflected his past life in a poignant yet delightfully brutal manner dealing with everything from familial friction to the literal end of the world the ambition on show is staggering making it all the more impressive that it pulled it off and remains one of this generation's finest games [Music] just take a quick glance at one of its eye-catching menus or listen to five seconds of its Acid Jazz soundtrack and you'll quickly realize that no PlayStation game possesses more style than Persona 5 Royal a 100 hour roller coaster ride through Modern Tokyo and its darker parallel metaverse the Royal version enhances the original Persona 5 by adding an extra chapter and gameplay tweaks to an already Stellar RPG it's a flashy fun foray into the hearts of the worst people encountered by the Phantom thieves a group of teenagers pulling off Inception like Heist using monsters pocketed along the way your gang of heroes must do all that while also managing the delicate bonds created in its high school setting incredibly exciting from start to finish it cemented Atlas as one of the all-time great RPG Studios such as the code of the Phantom Fe why you can lose [Music] with the gallon Knight protects the princess Fair remake Resident Evil 2 sure why not Resident Evil 3 haven't seen that one for a while but remaking Resident Evil 4 doesn't that feel too soon isn't Resident Evil 4 already perfect well it turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks Capcom decided to tackle the seemingly imp possible task of remaking one of the greatest video games of all time rather than a beat for beat remake Capcom took some ingenious liberties with re4 doubling down in the horror and losing some of the campier elements of the original it still strikes that perfect balance between scares and action but the PlayStation 2 horror classic may just have been usurped with its newest edition this is kind of [Music] fun oh sh here we go again another Grand Theft Auto entry finds its way onto this list GTA San Andreas displayed a new level of ambition from Rockstar as it look to evolve the open World Series in the ps2's Twilight years a mammoth-sized map for the mid-2000s included three entire cities and miles of Countryside in between with every square inch of it acting as a playground for CJ Johnson as he navigated the gang Warfare and police corruption plaguing his home state you haven't forgotten about us have you boy hell no officer Tamp peny I was just wondering what took y'all so long experimenting with new life simes mechanics and a satirization of more mature topics amongst the [ __ ] costumes and comical dildo fights it signaled the direction that Rockstar would take as it moved into the HD generation Drive these next tests require cooperation consequently they have never been solved by a human that's where you come in tucked away in 2007's Orange Box bundle was a small scale interdimensional puzzle game called portal it was fun created a few memes had a great song and a story [Music] right well for Portal 2 developer valve decided a fun distraction wasn't enough along with a much more comprehensive story and more ingenious puzzles for the sequel valve doubled down on the fun with one of the best co-op modes ever made for a puzzle game or any game for that matter don't disappoint me 30 seconds going dark Call of Duty's first Venture into a contemporary setting couldn't have gone much better a memorable Globe trotting campaign packed with instant classic missions such as all ghillied up combined with a multiplayer Suite of maps in an online progression system that would go on to define a generation of Shooters Modern Warfare changed the game when it burst onto the PS3 in [Music] [Applause] 2007 Silent Hill was always the David Lynch to resident Evil's George Romero the PlayStation's other iconic horror franchise prided itself on taking pure horror gaming as far as it could go and with Salen Hill 2 Konami created an unrelenting nightmare of a game everything about Silent Hill 2 from its creatures to horrible locations was meant to fill you with overwhelming dread forget power fantasy this is the game that forces you to take several deep breaths and calm your nerves before you push open the doors to some new horrifying location get the hell out of here leave me alone already [Music] Demon Souls may have been the first flame for from software's Rise but Dark Souls was where it truly set the bonfire Ablaze while the two share many similarities Dark Souls left the level likee structure of its predecessor behind in favor of a fully interconnected world the result is a physical place that's as mysterious and surprising as its deep and naughty backstory and just as difficult to work through foes like orstein and SM are still spoken about in hallowed tones now fromsoft has since made better games but it's hard to argue against Dark Souls being the Studio's most significant [Music] [Music] achievement it's easy to forget just how huge the Gran Turismo series is the third game Gran Turismo 3 asec was the bestselling exclusive on the bestselling console of all time with over 14 million copies be sold the PS2 racing Sim blew people away at the time with unmatched graphical power attention to detail and authentic car handle what could so easily be an overwhelming experience for those used to the arcade Rough and Tumble of Need for Speed Gran Turismo 3 managed to lure in even the most casual of fans thanks to its intelligently designed progression system that ranged from fun test track challenges to concentration testing and multi-hour endurance races in an era when driving games were all rage ASC created an unmatched Legacy coming out on top as the best of the [Music] bunch Persona 4 Golden was for many in the west their first exposure to the Beloved jrpg series an enhanced version of the 2008 original first seen on the PS2 Persona 4 Golden managed to successfully balance the series trademark tone of high school Antics with darker issues that plague our world all while going on the hunt for a serial killer plaguing a rural Japanese town the elemental rock paper scissors inspired turn-based combat was a fantastic Stepping Stone from the likes of Pokemon into a realm of more mature RPGs which was brought to life with an unforgettable cast of characters that coupled with an earworm of a soundtrack and a distinct visual style make Persona 4 Golden Hands Down the best game released for the PlayStation VA Sony's High powerered handheld might not have been a commercial hit but it did introduce many to the Persona series and for that it deserves all the praise in the [Music] world few games have had as much of an impact on RPG design as The Witcher 3 wild Hunt CD project Red's Landmark fantasy epic practically reinvents the side quest transforming optional Adventures from extracurricular busy work into complex twisty narratives that were as deep and essential as any main chapter geralt side hustles add a unique richness to the overarching story coloring between the grimy lines as each tale overlaps and intertwines making the game's famous choices and their often devastating consequences all the more powerful you really do feel the world and its people people move with each decision you make The Witcher 3 is unquestionably the greatest RPG in the PS4 library but its position as such is such a fascinating indicator of change PlayStation's RPG history is primarily a Japanese story told by the likes of squaresoft and Konami but the 2010 saw more and more traditionally PC focused Western developers bringing their RPGs to console the fact that wild Hunt the final chapter in a PC game TR Trilogy was able to prove such a massive succcess on Playstation is a testament to its revolutionary roleplay [Music] design it's hard to think of a game more ahead of its time than Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater reframing the Espionage action series as a 60 set James Bond style Behind Enemy Lines Mission its intricate stealth and camouflage systems bold cinematic flourishes and unmatched boss design make its release on the PS2 seem like a miracle for 2004 naked snake's Journey Through the Soviet jungle manages to balance moments of genuine emotional weight best showcased by his final showdown with former Mentor the boss with points of frivolity and experimentation an indulgent theme song crocodile headwear and of of course a famously long ladder sequence just to name a few however it's in those game-changing Boss Designs that Snake Eater truly shines the multiple ingenious ways you can take down elderly sniper the end the thrilling Shaga Chase and vulgan Showdown and of course the stunning surroundings of that aformentioned encounter with the boss Snake Eater was a masterpiece at the time of its release and remains one to this day so it's quite a relief that the upcoming remake is barely changing a thing about it [Music] the Castlevania Series has always provided fun sidescrolling action games but with Symphony of the Night it was no longer just a game where you ran from left to right the game setting of Dracula's castle is instead one open-ended map for protagonist alukard to freely explore with all four directions demanding equal attention while heavily inspired by Super Metroid Symphony of the Night made its own important contributions to a genre it would go on to co-headline from the shifting map to adding RPG light experiences conquering this giant puzzle of a map as it twists and turns throughout the story immediately puts into perspective just what a Monumental accomplishment Symphony of the Night turned out to be I'll guide you to meet your destiny as PlayStation entered the 3D era Symphony of the Night arrived in the darkness as a true swan song to 2D gaming and the triumphant start of the Metro Vania genre praise be to Goji [Music] gashi the biggest surprise in Elden ring might just be how similar it is to pass from software games but don't let the time tested combat and epic boss battles fool you Elden ring is a Monumental achievement and a true Evolution that Rose from the primordial RPG soup Demon Souls served up on PS3 every corner of its massive open world holds some kind of new secret boss fight or dungeon and the freedom it extends the players feels downright radical compared to other open world RPGs must extinguish thy flame while some games have a fear that players might get lost without some sort of invisible guidance Elden ring provides players with a few specs of light to point them in the approximate right direction but otherwise lets them loose unto its magnificent playground pick a direction encounter a boss fight that's too hard change directions and then you find an even harder boss it's great I have to finish it violent sad scary and irrepressibly Grim The Last of Us Part Two isn't best described as a fun time but it is a phenomenally powerful one 2020s ell Leed sequel to one of the most recognizable games of all time took us to the Rainy overgrown streets of Seattle on a trip that spirals through all seven layers of Hell naughty dog's most intricate combat system to date delivers fast and energetic stealth combat that's far superior to its comparatively clunky predecessor infected and humans alike are dispatched with difficult watch ferocity Ellie has had to grow up a lot in the time between this and the PS3 original and both the gameplay and story brutally reflect the harsh realities of her world but it's the introduction of Abby that is part 2's Master stroke her perspective into this post-apocalyptic America is initially jarring but it proves to be a prime example of how to play with split narratives in the medium you may not enjoy the outcome this isn't a story that presents good and bad as a clearly defined concept but it's a wholly ambitious swing from a studio that's willing to push the borders on what is expected from a video [Applause] [Music] game there are many contenders for the best entry in the Resident Evil series but our vote emphatically goes to the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 the original Resident Evil 2 took everything successful about the survival horror formula established by its older sibling and refined it the locations were creepier the enemies more menacing and the scares were bigger and batter what the hell is that the adventures of Leon and CLA in Raccoon City not only became a benchmark for Resident Evil but also set the standard for a Playstation Blockbuster but in every way that 1998's Resident Evil 2 improved on its predecessor the Remake also replicated in kind it's a prime example of how to take an older game and reanimate it for a new generation of players pioneering a new generation of scares that are often imitated but rarely equaled Resident Evil 2 sits at top the pile when it comes to one of PlayStation's most famous series the future of Boulders gate hangs in the balance will you be the hero and save it from looming Darkness perhaps it's bold of us to put balers Gate 3 in the top 10 with its complex character menus and fiddly inventory screens Lan's Dungeons and Dragons Adventure is clearly a died in the wool PC game but there's no getting away from the simple fact that while balers Gate 3 is far from a classic PlayStation game it is undoubtedly one of the very best games you can play on Sony's current machine a Monumental achievement in RPG design balers Gates World reacts to your every single decision be that something as simple as a little white lie or as devilishly Grand as slaughtering an entire population also chaos in your way the physical and emotional impact of those choices can be felt across the entire Journey shaping the character arcs of your companions and adjusting the trajectory of the Epic finale and by painstakingly translating the D and D rule book into video form larion ensures battle is just as malleable as its storylines dozens and dozens of skills abilities and weapon options means you can mold each character into the warrior of your choosing and devise creative strategies to decimate your foes few experiences f as bespoke to you as balers Gate 3 and that's why this traditionally PC experience deserves to live alongside PlayStation's Heavy [Music] Hitters beyond all the crime Cinema homages and wanton violence the Grand Theft Auto series has been an exercise in perfecting the urban open World Rockstar finally nailed it of GTA 5's Los Santos a digital City that feels authentically alive in the campaign the streets heartbeat comes courtesy of the series most accomplished Mission chain which combines the character study Narrative of GTA 4 with the wild objective variety of San andreus the ambitious character switching mechanic gels perfectly with the story's Heist Focus pivoting the action between the team's specializations as each job demands but as good as the campaign is it's GTA 5's multiplayer mode that captured the imagination of millions taken online Los Santos becomes a crime playground where it's the purge every day superficially GTA online is a collection of PVP modes with a constant trickle of seasonal content to the people who walk at streets though it's a community stomping ground where friendships are forged rivalry sparked and dominance achieve multiplayer heists provide a taste of that Rockstar single player storytelling magic but it's the emergent Tales spun by players that make GTA online an enduring [Music] [Music] favorite it's not hyperbole to say that Uncharted 2 among Thieves charted the course for the next 15 years of PlayStation history its predecessor built solid if unspectacular foundations but it's in Nathan Drake's Himalayan Adventure that he really found his footing it's ironic in some ways then that it took him hanging off the end of a derailed Mountainside train for him to do that for many among Thieves Remains the apex of the Uncharted series although just as many would argue in favor of a thief's in but there's no doubt that two is the most impactful its explosive dedication to delivering Blockbuster cinematic action with spark A Fire Inside Sony to make single player stories like this their focus for a decade and a half to come naughty dog's PS3 Legacy can be seen in everything from God of War to Ghost of sushima to Horizon zero Dawn arguably PlayStation's most important Studio the real strength of naughty dog's achievements began here with Uncharted [Music] 2 ladies and gentlemen this is a robbery sons of Dutch makes us Brothers the highest ranking multi-platform game on our list Red Dead Redemption 2 saw Rockstar hit its greatest creative Heights following a chain of success that had been tied to the PlayStation since the PS2 offering unparalleled Emer into the American West at the turn of the 20th century the Fateful tale of Arthur Morgan is arguably still the best looking game on a PlayStation console despite having been released on a past Generations Hardware in 2018 but Red Dead Redemption 2 is so much more than just a technical achievement it is an open world developer firing on all cylinders inviting you to get lost in its land full of quirky characters genuinely worthwhile side activities and of course an impeccably told story only the feeblest of men take jobs in the government with the devilishly charismatic Dutch vanderland operating as his foil Arthur steals the hearts of any who controls him making us cherish each and every moment spent walking in his shoes a world weary man with a violent past looking to usher in a brighter future for those close to him he's brilliantly reflective of the time and place he lives in managing to tell such an engaging and affecting tail in as huge an open world setting as this is an art form in its own right and through Red Dead Redemption 2 Rockstar showed us why it's the master of its [Music] craft stay with me you have to love yourself [Music] AAR in comparison to the new and exciting remake project the original Final Fantasy 7 looks little quaint The Winds of time and technological progress will do that but this Landmark Japanese RPG was a GameChanger for Sony not only did it see the developer squaresoft defect from Nintendo in order to use the power of the PlayStation to create the first ever 3D Final Fantasy it also communicated that Sony's console could deliver much more than just arcade and sports games on your TV Final Fantasy 7 showed everyone that PlayStation was the new home of Epic Adventures delivered on multiple discs those achievements may be a thing of the past now but Final Fantasy 7's Legacy endures because of the elements that refuse to age its cast of detailed emotionally driven characters develop over the course of a journey that balances personal Stakes against the backdrop of a luming apocalypse similar balance is found in tone this is a game with weight and heft that thrives on idiosyncrasies a variety of bizarre enemies comedic mini gamess and absurdly sized swords it's this combination of light and dark that make Final Fantasy 7 such an enduring [Music] classic you have no idea what loss is Naughty Dogs games have always been a sign of changing times for PlayStation shifting from mascot Platformers to action games to cinematic adventures The Last of Us is the shining example of that latter phas a game that took the interactive movie Ambitions of Uncharted and grounded them in a compelling character drama exploring the surrogate fatherdaughter relationship between Joel and Ellie the increasingly distressing circumstances of the post-apocalypse setting help drill deep into raw emotions and personality flaws the script elevated to Classic status thanks to Performance by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson is smaller scale and less ambitious than its sequel but has proven more enduring in the minds of Gamers thanks to its focus on the relationship between its Central Duo many of its achievements are admittedly found in its movie great cutscenes but the last of us wouldn't rank so highly on this list if it weren't for the way Naughty Dog entwined its narrative and gameplay goals the survival horror inspired gameplay communicates a sense of desperation be that in the constant search for supplies DIY equipment or the messy struggle that is melee while Ellie is technically invulnerable to damage combat triggers a guardian likee rage inside of you a feeling that pays off to tremendous effect when it comes to the muddy morality behind its final Act Joel I can handle myself it's called luck and it is going to run out taking down giant bosses in a fantasy world is meant to be fun and yes there's a certain amount of glowing satisfaction to be found in clamoring up one of shadow of the colossus's many skyscraper sized creatures but it's the distressing emotive response that's triggered by plunging wander blade into the creatures weak spots that makes team M's Masterpiece so special as black liquid spurts into the sky and the Monsters dying breaths chase you it's not Joy but sadness that sweeps the screen Conquering the colossi is pretty much Melancholia defined team io's second fantasy world is sparse yet haunting largely empty apart from the hulking figures that call it screen Fields treacherous deserts and vast Lakes home each one is a delicate puzzle waiting to be unlocked the battles proving to be enigmas that demand the use of brain over braa this artistic poetic approach creates a singular piece of work only enhanced by the stunning PS4 remake that arrived 13 years after the original first lumbered onto the PS2 you may have some regrets following your in-game actions in Shadow of the Colossus but you'll certainly be left with none about experiencing it [Music] [Music] at first glance bloodborne is another great souls-like RPG from the studio that created the genre but look a little deeper and you'll find something truly Sinister running through its veins yes the boss fights are Supreme and the level design is tremendous but there are dark and old Secrets hidden all throughout bloodborne the way the game unravels set secrets for the player is the true Majesty of from software's PlayStation 4 Magnum Opus this isn't just a game with hidden treasure chest behind disappearing walls taking direct inspiration from author HP Lovecraft from software took the concepts of Arcane knowledge and eldrich horror and translated them beautifully into video game form parts of bloodborne don't even reveal themselves to player until they gain a certain amount of insight which can only be revealed from encounter bloodborne's most horrifying and beautiful sites bloodborne isn't just action RPG greatness it's pure interactive literature he doesn't know does he about your true nature or his own the peak of modern PlayStation 2018s God of War is the quintessential cinematic Blockbuster that defines Sony's first party pedigree Santa Monica Studio's Masterpiece acts as not just the reinvention of a series but also the reinvention of a beloved character slow down your haste will cost us it takes Kratos on a journey as heart-wrenching as it is heads spitting the combat is fierce and the performances Nuance something perfectly exemplified in the unforgettable sequence when the exiled Spartan recovers his long buried blades a moment that draws you in emotionally before bursting into a fiery frenzy of violence it's all elegantly woven into a tale that all elegantly woven into a tale that tells a profoundly human story in its beautiful god-filled mythological world all anchored by a seamless never cutting camera that makes sure you never miss a beat a Monumental achievement in both narrative construction and game design is PlayStation's best game of this [Music] Century can't be you were killed in zanbar [Music] the word PlayStation has become synonymous with a very particular kind of game a singleplayer blockbuster that definitely weaves together cinematic storytelling with smart accessible gameplay mechanics while that reputation was truly solidified during the PS3 era its roots go right back to 1998 and the original PlayStation's most enduring Masterpiece Metal Gear Solid director hadel Kima brought his Cinema Obsession to the console through a dramatic Espionage story that frequently sacrificed playtime in order to examine its characters through lengthy well-performed dialogue sequences but it looks like our little diversion got their attention now is your best chance to slip in unnoticed despite its playful often times metatone Metal Gear Solid explores the theoretical real world consequences of nuclear aggression with genuine insight delving into subject that remain as essential today as they did in the late '90s between the codec calls though are Metal Gear Solid strongest achievements we can't forget its all important Vision col revealing radar which enables a brilliant stealth experience in which Bond likee gambits are easily planned and executed but its true highlight are the bosses each a perfectly executed duel with its own bespoke mechanics the fan favored of course being psycho mantis whose mind reading powers gave players a start and whose input inverting Powers could only be overcome by switching controller ports but really every single one of Metar solids wild Rogues Gallery is a special showdown in its own right there are arguments to be made that later Metal Gear Solid entries went on to offer better experiences but despite their respective achievements none of them nor any other game on this list are anywhere close to being as truly revolutionary memorable or timeless as the original Metal Gear Solid is the PlayStation [Music] game and there you have it IGN's Top 100 PlayStation games of all time as decided upon and argued about extensively by numerous members of our editorial staff the odds are your

more Monster Hunter Wilds that's coming soon I think that's likely Nick I see you chat I'm right there with you halflife three let's go let's make it happen I simultaneously think that sounds crazy but also really want it to happen so we'll see I really want it to happen too I'm with you on that one for me Resident Evil 9 I think that's I think there's a good possibility too we know that's coming from Capcom so I think I think that's four years ago 2020 yes 2020 um the hit Mev talked about project 007 so maybe some golden eye that has been a long time coming as well okay before we get started I want to let you know IGN plus is our exclusive program for IGN members where tons of awesome games and prizes are at your fingertips right now we're giving you $10 off annual IGN Plus subscription with code holiday so sign up now at ign.com plusus all right let's kick things off with some of the biggest reveals we expect to see at tonight's show let's get right into it Borderlands 4 we know is going to be here uh this is we we got a teaser trailer earlier this year with with you know just the reveal I think we're going to get a gameplay reveal Borderlands 4 what would we want to see from Borderlands 4 Borderlands 3 is the best selling Borderlands game so far so it did very well the movie didn't do so hot but they want to move fast that put it behind them mhm what do you want to see from Borderlands 4 I want to see the characters the characters is what makes Borderlands we've got some fantastic casts throughout all the previous games I just want to see who they are and I want to know which siren I get to play as this time cuz it's always the siren for me sure Nick we've talked about in Games scoop how uh sometimes we get annoyed with with bullet sponge enemies and Borderlands has those yeah it is I think the quintessential example of hey if is the difficulty up just a nudge then this enemy is going to take a r of bullets before they get put down but that said I do think Borderlands U you know I might not be the biggest fans of the Borderlands franchise but I am a big fan of how they do weapons they are very creative with what they do with the weapons and I'm hoping to see something just as impressive yeah oh yeah you fan of the Borderlands franchise got to play it I really enjoyed uh Borderlands 2 I specifically have a lot of memories with my brothers playing that one so for Borderlands 4 just thinking of the teaser that they launched a few months ago I just want to see what that planet is the plan that is being crashed into that whole dimension multi-dimension thing we got going on in that trailer I just want to see what's going on there and have them explain it yeah I was also a big fan of Borderland 2 and it's been it's been I think Borderland 3 is 2019 I want to say so and like so many spin-offs later yeah it's been a minute I I I feel I'm ready I'm ready to return to Borderlands I'll play another Borderlands let's do it we also know uh I think there's been one leak so far this year only one which is pretty good several leaks the the Mafia the old country releas a trailer uh leaked ahead of time with the release window of I think summer 2025 interesting uh to be getting a new mafia game in the same year as a new Grand Theft Auto yeah but I mean I think it's going to really set itself apart with its just kind of location and environments that we're going to get with Mafia the old country compared to what we're expecting in GTA 6 which is pseudo Florida um and so and what I can see from our community and chat and anytime this game has been brought up they are extremely hyped for Mafia old country this I think this game is going to be a major surprise and shake up in 2025 Nick or either of you Mafia fans yeah I like Mafia I think um it kind of sets it uh sets itself apart from Grand Theft Auto by being very selfs serious but in a good way it is very Godfather esque and um I think with the old country going back to the old country it is going to be evocative of the best Godfather Part Two so uh that should be an exciting time this will probably be the game that throws me into the criminal underworld in the video games uh with this Mafia I've seen it many times I've seen people have so much fun with it I know they it has a huge fandom and I've always been attracted to it I've seen it this might be the one that makes me play it all right it's well documented um Jeff key and hideo kajima have a a friendship in Kim yep it's true I know kajima often makes appearances at the game awards and he is confirmed to be making appearance tonight so of the projects that he's working on death stranding to OD and Fant what do we think we like to see this evening I mean I think we're most likely to see death stranding 2 on the beach but I would love to see more of OD that's the one I has me most excited or in intrigued I guess is the right word OD was shown at the game awards last year and there's I don't think there's been any updates on it since but this is something he's working with Xbox on I believe and Jordan Peele yeah that's right yeah I'm really intrigued by the cloud they said they were working on the cloud uh with with Xbox and I I was thinking back on the metal gear solids when coima was working on them and how they kind of messed with the player a little bit so I'm wondering how they're going to use that cloud technology to mess with the player since OD is a scary it's meant to be a horror game could you potentially receive phone calls text messages through the cloud system to scare you and immerse you into the game I don't know transf faring is coming back the PSP it's coming back baby for death stranding two do I think a release date I I think we got to get a release at this point I feel like we've seen so much of the game and I believe you mentioned that in the Tokyo game show they teas that we would be seeing uh or hearing more about a release date for death stranding 2 and at this point I don't need to see more from the game I just want to know when I'll be able to play it on my PlayStation 5 Pro they said soon four months ago so this could be the soon it should be soon it should be soon I'm expecting at least a release window like a a a season I think spring 2025 call you think it's that that that soon I'm calling I'm shooting my shot the only reason why I don't say we get a date is because so many people are afraid of GTA 6 right now and don't think death stranding is that same kind of competitor but I think they're still going to play it safe yeah it is true going into next year I think everyone will be waiting to see when GTA 6 uh lands on its release date because no one wants to be anywhere near that very true what about Fant this is the game that kajima is working on with Sony Pictures I believe and it's supposed to be the spiritual successor to Metal Gear yeah I mean I as a gigantic Metal Gear fan this is the one that I'm most interested in just because gojima Metal Gear you know he parted with with Konami on not amicable terms so seeing him return to the Tactical Espionage action is going to be super exciting and now it sounds like it's going to be tactical Espionage fashion action because I know fashion is going to be one of the big major 10 Poes for whatever Fant ends up being and fashion is doing big right now Infinity Nikki just dropped it's got major fans 10 million downloads already so microtransactions inant confirmed question mark you do let us know all right let's think about Bethesda Todd Howard is presenting tonight he's got um Doom the Dark Ages coming earlier next year I think uh a new look at Doom is is reasonable I would love more Doom Dark Ages that game looks fire yeah and I think just writing the momentum of the high that is in Deana Jones I think bethesda's you know getting its feet under them again as I know it was Todd Howard's like secret project that it was like his precious little baby so I could see him being the face of just you know on not only Bethesda but ID software and machine games obviously so yeah I think I think it makes sense I hope they do show us a little bit more of doomed to Dark Ages is one of my favorite games from the last years that I've played and I need to see Doom Slayer in the Dark Ages and flying on what was it dragon mount that we get to go on Mech it's Shing up skulls to make projectiles get skulls into your gun it's it's just the coolest most metal ass game which I just really appreciate commitment to the medal yeah and while we're on the topic of you know Xbox owned games AOW is coming early next year too very hyp that's in that's in February I believe so it's possible although maybe Xbox would want to save that to do like its own like showcase dedicated to it in January or something yeah I feel like we've seen a lot of AOW I think I don't think that's the this is the right stage for that at this point but you know I wouldn't be mad to see a little bit more we also have a very generous preview that's available on ign.com so make sure you check that out good Shout good shout okay uh Sam Lake from remedy is another uh we uh recent he makes a lot of appearances at the game awards he's going to be a presenter that's confirmed so with Allan Wake 2 out the the lak house DLC is out I think the next thing they have coming is FBC fire break which is their Cooperative multiplayer game based in the control Universe yeah it's set in the FBC I believe yeah you think that's more most likely what would we see from him I I believe so I think FBC makes the most sense uh we've got a huge audience to check out this game I think this one is definitely more under the radar than say something like the max P REM remakes or remasters that they're doing or control 2 I think this one is one of those games that would benefit the most from a bigger audience seeing more of it I'm a romantic at heart so I say this game is somewhat of a known quantity in that it is just a co-op PVE shooter with buddies which is great don't get me wrong but when I think of Remedy I think of first person I'm sorry single player experience that really wow and I think based on what we got in the lak DLC for Allen wake 2 I wouldn't be surpris if we got another look at control two fingers crossed call me crazy but hey I like crazy I like is the FBC what is it called I'm missing fire bre is that is that something that's on your radar that you want to see more of yeah I want to see more uh I want to I want to see a game that is you know up my alley I like Shooters single player uh FPS games third person shooters anything that has guns in it like Doom um this game seems to be a PVE game that is right up my alley so I'm excited to see what they show Nick I feel like you're you know I I think you should make your case for why you think it's possible halflife three could be appearance tonight you want me to go down the rabbit hole all right here stick with me here so Jeff key has an established relationship with valve uh we've seen that uh with his publishing of halflife 2 the Final hours halflife Alex the final hours basically anytime a new valve thing comes out he usually gets some sort of insight where he gets to talk about the development process with the team at valve that's one thing two we got the 20th anniversary documentary for halflife 2 that was one incredible but two it ends on a very like wink wink nudge nudge we know you want halflife three so I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised in the near future we've seen valve software become this like obviously they are the house of steam but but they are becoming a publishing house again a development house we see deadlock coming out we've seen their failed card game come out we've seen them make new things which is a little bit unusual halflife Alex was incredible and um I know that they are bringing back the halflife 2 making of book which was long sought after because they put it on their store it's gone forever and then they brought it back with the documentary so halflife is in the air and I couldn't think of a more Earth shattering announcement to end the game Awards with then Mr Freeman it's time to wake up Nick the chat is going crazy uh it's all halflife 3 right now uh one of our users on YouTube chemically stupid please don't do this to us I I'm right there with you I'm right there with you I might be setting myself up for failure but hey like I said I'm a romantic I like the dream big you know what I'll be right there with you I woke up today we hadn't talked about this at all and I sat here and I said halflife three and he said halflife three wait a minute there's something going on there's something in the air they said two Earth shattering announcements what else could it be it has to be halflife something I mean I hope you're right it would be great I'm going to be hooting and hollering I'll do a lap around the desk if it happens okay well whether or not we see half lifee three one thing we know we're going to see is um Haz Light Studios next game that's Joseph Ferris uh from it takes two and what was a way out before that so incredible Co-op experi they make Co-op experiences and the next one I think the title leaked called split fiction we know that's going to get a big reveal there tonight so what sort of a what sort of Co-op game do you hope this is I mean knowing like I don't know Joseph but just knowing his kind of General ideological perspective when it comes to approaching you know his um co-op games he likes to do unique things and stuff that you've never really seen or done before so I'm assuming you know if it's called split fiction I'm assuming there's some interesting narrative stuff happening from a co-op perspective and I think that's an untapped market for interesting ideas because one of the biggest pains when you're playing co-op with someone is someone accidentally advancing the story while you're still looking in this corner over here so maybe he figured out a way of uh circumventing that who knows I'm expecting a whole bunch of different stages each with Unique Mechanics kind of like what we got in it takes two where there's you know there's levels where you you had like guns and there's another ones where you were like combat level yeah I would love to see just all types of different more genres just kind of mixed into it split fiction just reminds me of for some reason time Splitters so I'm thinking futuristic Co-op platform or we get to you know play with with our buddies hopefully we get some online I think co-op games need some online co-op cuz playing co-op on land sometimes you're sitting in your couch alone you know um can I play with my friends online I would love to see that hopefully we get a buddy pass system back again where you know you get a copy of the game and you can share it with the Buddy and for free

expecting looks at some games we've never seen before but first let's take a look at an exclusive new trailer for citizen sleeper 2 starward vector [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that was a look at citizen sleeper 2 starward Vector you can play citizen sleeper 2 when it releases next year on January 31st okay now we just went over what we know will be at the show let's talk about who will be presenting why that could be important as well as a ton of other confirmed announcements going into the show let's start with those more things that we know we know that um the head of Allan Sven Vin he's gonna be presenting it could just be you know last year balers gate 31 game of the year so maybe just presenting this year's Game of the Year Award right um I don't know what they could have to show we know they've started their next game but I think it's probably too early days yeah it's too early for to see what Lars up to we all we know is that it's not balers gate 4 they're still you know finishing off support on balers Gate 3 we've got like crossplay coming I believe early next year and sub classes and sub more sub classes yeah I'm hyped um but it's we do know that it's going to be more more than likely something that they can kind of control around and that they own yeah they've been pretty outspoken about like they kind of they're done with the Dungeons and Dragons license and are looking to kind of take full ownership of over their next title so I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Divinity original sin 3 Divinity original sin 2 rocks and I think that they could take a lot of learning from their time in balers Gate 3 and apply that to the next entry in Divinity original sin I think the balers gate like Fame will also bring a lot more newcomers into Divinity s because I know a lot of people didn't really know of that series until balers gate yeah also great games yeah now we know uh Warframe 1999 which is the DLC update for Warframe uh promises to take players back to the beginning I like you you familiar with Warframe right yeah yeah it took three years of my life playing that game yeah um shout out to digital extremes for for that um yeah Warframe uh 1999 this is a uh going back in time to 1999 so we're going to take a character called The Drifter or your own character it's going to be an adult version going go back in time and you can experience the world at that time but it's going to be also inspired uh in you're going to see some Dark Sector for anybody familiar with Dark Sector you might see some some little call outs to that game uh in in this one uh it's it's cool there's there's going to be a new story expansion on here and some new factions too to to be clear you're talking about the Xbox 360 PS3 game Dark Sector how is that related to Warframe digital extremes okay so they developed it theyel published Dark Sector the man with the little Tri glaive I love it projectile I had no idea but that kind of rocks so you you said the guy's name is The Drifter so The Drifter how do I explain Warframe is that is that the character that that um Ben star is playing how do I explain Warframe lore I remember when I started this and I asked what is Warframe lore and everyone was like listen you just have to play it um The Drifter is is a character that introduced in the story of Warframe and it's how do I even explain this it's a version of of yourself uh when you're when you're a tenno which is the the character I'm going to nerd out here I'm sorry this is the place for that this is the place for that so your character is called a tenno and I believe earlier you asked me uh how warframes are connected to tenno or tenno inside the Warframe um the tenno is connected via transference and energy that fills the the Warframe so this character called a tenno also has a version of him called The Drifter so you're going to go back in time into 1999 and you're going to experience the world during that time and I see some cool characters being shown there um digital extremes has taken a really cool Direction with Warframe they've even introduce some characters so you've gone to not just play as your own created character but you've also been able to go through different factions and characters and experience the Warframe story and do I see a motorcycle a bike in there too I just love how adventurous digital extremes is they're not shy they don't shy away from creating what they want in their game so 1999 should be a pretty cool story to jump into that looks really cool now we know they're going to um teeken 8 they're going to be showing the the final character for season one of Tekken 8 and jayen you had an interesting theory about who this might be yes the fans have been uh really hoping and sending all sorts of messages to haraan for Tifa as the final DLC character for this season pass and from Final Fantasy from Final Fantasy 7 Tifa would be a perfect fit she's that brawler listening and she's she's got the moves she's got the specials she's got all sorts of combos that you can pull off in Final Fantasy and I think she would be a perfect fit and probably my new main in Tekken 8 and it's not unprecedented either because um they've previously had Prince noctis from Final Fantasy 15 in Tekken so they've had Final Fantasy characters before in Tekken and if they did again Tifa in rebirth and the Remake felt like a fighting game character so it feels almost at home in Tekken I would love to see that hear me out okay here we go okay listen Master Chief has not been in a sing has not been in a single fighting game since he got released and fighting game people you know we've been asking for Master Chief to be in a single Super Smash not happening apparently maybe this could be the spot where Master Chief fits in I don't know I could see a plasma grenade grapple yeah he T sticks them with the grenade and then throws them off a cliff could see that all right we can see we have the countdown up now we're just five minutes away from the game awards uh so as soon as that begins we will hand you on over to Jeff in the game awards be sure to stick around after that for our postow coverage we'll be breaking down everything that we've uh just borne witness to couple other things we know are coming uh my man Aaron Paul is going to be presenting there so for Speed go let's go let's get a new Need for Speed game baby we could get a new I would love a new Need for Speed game yeah so I don't know if he's just presenting as a making a celebrity appearance or if he has something he's promoting I don't know um but then we have U the uh main actress from Fallout Ella Pernell is going to be uh presenting there or she's or I'm sorry she's a double nominee so I don't know if they're going to be showing um a little Glimpse at Fallout season 2 it feels appropriate I feel like the game awards make sense for a sneak peek at Fallout season 2 I know that they've already started production on season 2 so and I think they said they wanted to Fast Track it too so yeah so I I could see a world where we see a little a sneak peek at a very uh beloved location in the Fallout Universe I'll save you any spoilers if you haven't watched season one but go do it it's very good and then two actors from The Last of Us world it's Isabella Merced who appears in season two of The Last of Us on HBO and then the Shannon Woodward who plays Dena in The Last of Us Part Two and apparently in she's in Alien Romulus which I just learned earlier she's also presal so they're both presenting so maybe a look at season two of Last of Us on HBO time for that also that also fits just like with the same Theory with the Fallout I think Last of Us season 2 is that's what February year early time for that so yeah another game that's coming early next year if we're just start to making uh predictions about what could make an appearance uh civ7 that out in February and we haven't seen any gameplay of it I think that is a good point we I think we actually had a pretty extensive uh preview for it on ign.com but that said it has been a minute and I know they haven't really detailed too much about the game yet so I'd be very curious I know we got a lot of fans of civ7 in the IGN offices so I'd be really thrilled for them to get another look at it because it's a game that they won't shut up about do we have any like far-fetched ideas I know bloodborne remake remaster bloodborne 2 there's the people are things that every year people want to see they want to see blood and they want to see silk song yep right see every time you say silk song in chat it gets delayed another day so like you just take everything in this chat alone and Well Done guys but yeah I think above all obviously halflife 3 would be incredible silk song for me though would be one of those that would just get me on on my feet cheering because it's been so long since I've played through Hollow night and I just want to go back I want to play silk song so bad in chat there were there was some hope for Elder Scroll 6 right Elder Scroll 6 yes I don't think we see Elder Scroll 6 tonight let alone this generation personally I we know it's a ways out and I think we see it you know come next console generation I think we if we see anything Elder Scrolls it's maybe a look at something older in their Library brought back in a form of a remaster or remake maybe a three like a Mor wind kind of yeah I've seen a lot of rumors of a Fallout 3 remaster that's been an ongoing Rumor for years now so who who knows that game would benefit pretty greatly from a remaster or a remake as would New Vegas and I think New Vegas being the one that kind of strikes me as a little more of a natural thing to remake given the popularity of the Fallout show but who knows who knows well Todd Howard is presenting alak at the top of the show you were saying you're hoping to see uh Resident Evil 9 yeah uh Resident Evil 9 I mean we just uh I want to know what happened to so the winter Saga officially ended with the DLC for res resent Evil 8 Village and there's been a lot of rumors lot of rumors online about what the characters will be for this new Resident Evil 9 there was a confirmation from the director that the game was officially happening five months ago um I want to see a a a release date for this game and I want to see who the main characters will be will it be Leon will Jill and Leon be teaming up together for the first time in Resident Evil 9 and how will Rose Winters be involved if she even will be I'm just I love horror games and Resident Evil is one of those that I absolutely need to see in the game awards yeah well based on capcom's pattern since you know the remake of two right they go back and forth between doing a remake and now it's time for the new numbered entry in the series Nick what do you think about s you have I got one one thing the chat popped up with our last couple seconds and I know Nick will be hyped for Kingdom Hearts 4 no way oh man I didn't even think about Kingdom Hearts but yeah there's a there's a good likelihood we see that so I'm right there with you chat I want to see Sora in shabuya let's make it happen anime is real 2025 let's make it happen all right the show is starting everybody enjoy and we'll see you on the other side half life three baby let's go half life three

CEO and founder of trees please games I've worked in games for the best part of 20 years PlayStation Disney Us 2 games Square enx I loved working there I loved working on such massive games but I actually had a sense of of guilt in parallel with my games career I've always had a passion or actually don't like to call it a passion I like to think of it more as a a sort of a purpose for making a difference in the world nice tree it's comfy we're less than 20 years away from climate collapse one and for me that's that's incredibly scary both for our future but for my children's future it struck me that there was such an opportunity to use these games that were reaching hundreds of millions of people to to create awareness Ness about what's happening in the world so when you play longle Valley you're restoring and saving a national park and then as you're playing you're actually collecting tree tokens to plant a real tree our players together have planted over 1.6 million trees now but it's amazing to know that together we are making a real difference [Music] [Music] I watch people running around 100 miles an hour trying to keep up with the Jon on a quest for power got

who devote their lives to entertaining and sometimes comforting or affecting us through video games in fact 25 years ago back in college I started writing a series of Articles called behind the game chronicling the development of games like halflife and Metal Gear Solid 2 because I knew games were nothing without the people behind them now the sad reality is that over the past few years the gaming industry has suffered significant and unprecedented industrywide layoffs those affect the games we get to play and even more importantly the people who make the games we love we can debate and certainly disagree with the reasons why and honestly as a show we we kind of struggle with how to address these Topics in a destructive way but this year inside of these challenges we found greatness I'm proud to share with you the story of a single individual who saw developers in need and did something truly extraordinary meet tga's first ever game changer starting in early 2023 significant waves of layoffs started in the games industry it strikes you it it hurts right it's like a ton of bricks what what am I supposed to do tens of thousands of Gamers have been laid off at a level that is unprecedented in the industry's history I love this brand I love this company oh my goodness what am I going to do I actually started in games relatively late even though I've loved the industry ever since I was a little child because there weren't games jobs around here I stayed passionate about it and broke through in basically my late 30s I had seen a few two friends get laid off before Thanksgiving and I said to my wife Jess like this is unacceptable hi everybody it's Amir and I'm here to help support you as you look for your next opportunity in video games I can't imagine what it must feel like for someone have to go to their family around the holidays and say I don't have a job I don't know what's going to happen I had a robust background in things like data analysis and I said well I can do something with this I started a community with one resource we just started putting together a list of all the job openings out there and over iteration after iteration and ended up

Neil Duckman and starring tati Gabrielle as Jordan mun I'm also happy to share the trailer you just saw and the full game will feature a new original score from Trent resner and attakus Ross the game has been in development since 2020 and we can't wait to learn more thanks to naughty dog and Playstation for that special announcement and now to present the biggest honor of the night over the past decade 10 distinguished titles have been recognized as game of the year please welcome last year's winner from laran Sven vinka [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I realize you guys have been sitting here for over 3 hours but I still have some time credits from last year to cash in so so it turns out that not only will I be the one who will know as first which game wins tonight they actually also know which game is going to win next year the year after and the year after now how do I know this well an oracle told me she said change is coming it's a modern Oracle so they made me sign an NDA but I trust all of you I know you can keep a secret you will never leak it the Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage it's stupidly simple but somehow it keeps on getting lost Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves they created it because it hadn't been created before they didn't make it to increase market share they didn't make it to serve as a brand they didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they me didn't meet those targets and furthermore the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design they didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet they didn't treat their players as users to exploit and they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics they knew that if you put the game and the team first the revenue will follow they were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun and they realized that if the developers didn't have fun nobody was going to have any fun they understood the value of respect that if they treated their developers and players well those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned but above all they cared about their game because they loved G games it's really that simple said the Oracle winning game of the earth turned out to be a lifechanging event for us it was an amazing thing to those who will win game of the year 2024 you have no idea what's waiting for you it's an incredible honor and you're in for a heck of a ride now remember should you be told to wrap it up for tonight you can always come back next here and chat for three minutes okay so now to pay tribute to the nomin NES for game of the year once again Lura Bal and the TJ Orchestra [Music] the [Music] [Music] this e [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the game of the year is astrobot [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what did you say your name was [Applause] [Music] I am master I am master I [Music] am I am [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow nothing I'm prepare you for that thank you so much I'm thinking once again to all the ases back in Japan you know all 65 of them right now they're crying so please a round of applause for them thank you it's you guys as um you know when I thought about you know why this game you know give people joy and smiles on their faces I think it came down to the people every day making the game and doing exactly that I think you know the when I think of the team is the amount of generosity they gave they put the user first always you know never thought about any you know any calculation it was just about the kids especially because we had this huge huge privilege to be potentially the first game to be in the hands of children and we know what it means very much um so timas will be really uh from the bottom of our heart you know well done and thank you so much now thank you I have to thank a few more people because a lot of people contributed to this game of course in si and Playstation or F Min you know Herman who give you know the studio a chance and Scott Roy who really believe in Astro even before we did Ken Channel marketing and many many other people that I'm not mentioning you know astrobot is full of 30 years of PlayStation history and actually a lot of people in this room tonight gave their characters their IP without asking anything in return just because they cared about celebrating 30 years so to them as well you know from the bottom of our heart thank you so much and then last and not least and you want to stay for this one because I didn't plan to say it but I'm going to say it anyway you know Platformers you know PlayStation 30 years and we made a platformer which is great it's very nostalgic and and fresh at the same time but let's not forget that even before PlayStation there were people making Platformers I remember I was a kid in 1989 Christmas and I got a gray box there was a game packed in he was Co Super Mario Brothers and it was really really great so we are in Japan we're in Tokyo they are in Kyoto but I want to pay tribute to the company who really put like Platformers and showed us Innovation and quality consistently and inspired us to actually make the game that we made so that's also and I've managed not to mention them have you noticed but you all know who they are and many other companies have been inspired over the years so that's very very important and we want to Tri you know pay tribute to them um tonight so from the bottom of thank you so much it's amazing and uh we'll see you again thank you so [Applause] [Music] much congratulations astrobot and that is going to do it for our 10th anniversary of the game awards more than anything thing I hope tonight made you believe the future of our medium is brighter and greater than ever congratulations to the winners and thanks to all the incredible teams around the world who shared their upcoming work with us today putting together this show has been so special to our team personally and professionally thanks to all of you for showing up and believing in me and the game awards we'll see you back here at the peacock theater for the game awards 2025 our 12th show live on Thursday December 11th 2025 thank you happy holidays have a good night [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to 's TJ post show I'm Damon that's Jada that's Nick and that's all yet but enough about us let's get right into it and talk about what we just saw tonight lots of big announcements to get to we'll be talking about Witcher four we'll be talking about Elden ring Night Guard no sorry night rain we talking about Borderlands 4 and so much more but let's begin with a big surprise from towards the end of the show this is the newest game from Naughty Dog it's called Intergalactic the heretic profit I am so excited for this I love naughty dog is a studio I love pretty much every game they've made uh so you know Color Me bias but man I am so so excited for this game the just everything you could see there's little details from a bunch of other games her the main character Jordan uh you saw Ellie's tattoo on one of her arms there was just so much Naughty Dog DNA just sprinkled into this trailer and little hidden bits like I'm I'm beyond hype for this yeah it might not have been halflife three but you know you shoot for the moon and you even if you miss you up Among the Stars right and I think that's what we did here with Intergalactic uh one thing that strikes me right away is just the kind of outrun Vapor wave uh atmosphere that it's kind of evoking a lot of uh retro future technology we see you know a Porsche in space very cool I think the protagonist is rocking Adidas we got a make a make believe anime that looks very good and even like the the video calling software that we're seeing it just looks like a just like an old vintage VHS and I just love everything I'm seeing and a Playstation blog post went up uh just after the announcement and it looks like our main character Jordan is Jordan a Jordan aun is a bounty hunter and she gets stranded on uh the planet I presumably we see at the end of the trailer chasing what looks like kumal n Giani so who knows if this is going to be a Metroid Prime situation but uh I'm intrigued I just saw got a better look at the tattoo it's actually like a like an octopus or a squid on there not not Ellie's tattoo I just absolutely love that the game just looks so so real the engine everything is in engines it just looks great at first I thought this looks like cyber Punk um it's it's it's incredible I cannot wait to see more gameplay of it and just the idea of going from the ship into the planet I hope we get to see and experience a little bit of that um when loading into the into the planet I just can't wait to see more yeah we have a little bit more information from Sony now on the Playstation blog so this has been in development since 2020 which makes sense since that's when the last of was part two came out so many years in development now and uh our protagonist here Jordan she's stranded on uh an alien planet called ceria it's a Planet whose communication with the outside Universe went dark hundreds of years ago in fact anyone who's flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past has NE was never heard from again Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit so it's this is like a a maroon you know try to survive and try to escape sort of scenario I dig it and one thing you know based on the the track record that na dogs had in its recent releases I'm looking at you um Uncharted Lost Legacy and even the last Last of Us Part Two we've seen them kind of ditch the more linear format that they've kind of adopted with the earlier Uncharted games and it's more open Hub style games and I'm hoping that this game is going to kind of elevate them to the next level of potentially open world where we're able to explore a fleshed out uh alien world with a lot of interesting things to see and do because their past couple of games have really kind of set that precedent M interesting you mentioned aliens we got to see I think it was a bot on the planet we didn't see yet to see any animals or monsters in there so I wonder what kind of beings exist in the planet that she's exploring and she had also a melee weapon looked pretty cool yeah like kind kind of lightsaber is sort of thing yeah and she kind of charged like a it looked like an automatic pistol type thing when she was in her ship and then obviously we see a transition over to the energy axe or whatever it is on the planet side the blog mentions some other like castmates that we'll eventually meet that my one of my biggest concerns is because na dog is such a narrative driven company and their games are so narrative driven and being alone STR on a planet kind of goes against what they're usually doing with a lot of the sure but it just says that this planet stopped communicating hundreds of years ago so there's probably other you know individuals there that she'll encounter yeah yeah something like that lots of branding in this in this trailer you mentioned the Porsche that she's flying the Sony is you know expected they don't have to go anywhere to use the Sony brand but then they also show she's wearing Adidas shoes and I just think it's an interesting choice because in a big reveal trailer like this everything you see is very very intentional right so they they some there's some reason I think that they're showing that they have branding in this world but Intergalactic the heretic profit so I mean a lot to unpack there with those very select words but again this is all just speculation there's a prophet potentially a heretic who knows it's cool do you think uh any guesses on you know in development for four years now when are we going to play this game I'd say at best early 20 or late 25 but I'm guessing like a spring 2026 I'm saying spring 2026 as well 2025 is packed right now I would say 2026 almost every game shown tonight was 2025 but what does that mean for PlayStation in terms of 2025 releases right well there's um uh ghost of Y ghost of Y we've got I'm sure we're going to see a lot more hell diver support we still have a couple things we're waiting to hear from other Studios that haven't announced things that may be close to working on some Santa Monica I'm sure there's other things they've got other Studios have gotten the works as well we also learned that the soundtrack for Intergalactic is being done by Trent Reser and attakus Ross so it's going to be good great thing you know it's going to be a great soundtrack yeah I'm excited for this uh you know it's been a long time it's been four years since their NAU dog's last full game I like pretty much everything they do I like sci-fi settings so I'm definitely on board with Intergalactic I'm glad they uh used restraint and did not go with the BC Boys in Intergalactic in that would be very all too easy two spot on yeah two spot on well let's talk about some other uh big announcements Witcher four we talked about this in our pre-show it's it's we were we were right got that one right yep I'm so excited for Witcher four I think we all are I'm pretty sure I screamed a little bit when I I I expected this game to be announced in the game awards I'm just so happy that we actually got to see it that we got confirmation that Siri is the main protagonist that she has fully become a Witcher we even got to see her transformation in her eyes like she got her cat eyes I just I just cannot wait to see what this journey is going to take on for her it's it's completely different character than geralt oh 100% we had um also incredible work to uh Matt perso who is our IGN UK correspondent who actually went to CD project red and has a fully flushed out um kind of uh interview with CD project red diving into The Witcher 4 and one thing that they touch on as you mentioned she has the cat eyes um following The Witcher 3 it looks like Siri does undergo the trial of the grasses which is the um kind of ritual all uh willbe witchers undergo a lot of them die she does not apparently and she has become now a Witcher and one thing that stood out to me about the interview that Matt conducted was that um that Siri is a more impassioned person compared to geralt geralt's a lot more logical and she lets her you know she wears her heart on her sleeve it seems and I'm really curious to see how that is a different uh authored experience from Geral but letting your emotions control you is the path of the dark side yeah true our chat is actually in this is their biggest thing for the night I've been polling our chat all night uh I put our final poll up between the biggest four which was Intergalactic Witcher four Elden ring night rain and Borderland 4 and currently as the votes stand Witcher four is leading with 39% of the votes so the the chat is seems like they're very happy for what you're for they're excited to see it I love that we're getting Siri I think she's GNA be a Fant fantastic protagonist I just can't wait to see the different abilities and skills that she brings to the table and I don't think you know for people who are sad that you're not going to play as Galt if I I believe at the end of the trailer we heard geralt speak a little bital will be in the game I imagine he's going to be a more vasir like Mentor like I'm looking on but you do Your Own Thing Siri so I'm excited for that yeah and his voice actor had said recently that you know he he was going to be in the game but just not the main character and then you had to walk that back a little bit slap on the I think it's pretty clear that geralt's in in the game in some capacity well one thing that's cool too is in the trailer it looks like Siri taking on um a kikim which is like an arachnid style enemy which you've seen in The Witcher at some point but I just the witcher's so good at doing cinematic like story scenes like this that are probably not even going to be in the game but are probably super important to the story of the game um and one other thing that stood out out to me about the trailer is right at the very start it did say that this game or this trailer was rendered um using unidentified NextGen NVIDIA GTX uh graphics processor which means everyone's wallets are going to be hurting because that's likely running on like a 5090 or something because I know Witcher 3 was marketed with the 2080 if I'm not mistaken back when it came out so this is going to make PCS cry all across the land and I can't wait yeah it looks visually impressive this is definitely ue5 so like we're going to I'm expecting great quality out of this one I actually found some information on the monster that we got to see his name is Bach and he has the ability B Bob maybe Bob Bach he has the ability to smell your fear to be able to play with your traumas to paralyze you so that you can become easy PR prey and an easy meal I wonder how that's going to play in the game if if there's going to be an interaction there with with Siri and her abilities but it was so cool to see this monster and in in the game and the way she actually defeats it too she seems to use her unique Siri abilities to be able to save herself mhm yeah I think that's what's going to really set Siri apart from geralt is her magical abilities like obviously geralt has access to weaker magic Allah signs but Siri can straight up teleport and things like that so I'm curious to see if there's going to be um better traversal because let's be real uh as as good as The Witcher 3 is movement ain't among the top things that's a about that game so I'm excited to see not only Siri as a character but also this is the first time CD project Reds adopted ue5 um I believe cyber Punk and Witcher 3 were on red engine which was their proprietary in-house engine so curious to see how they acclimate to ui5 and see uh if if it pays off in the long run B unversal you didn't like roach just running through the whole anywhere time you called them I don't like geralt dying from a 5 foot drop whenever he jumps off of a little ledge are we get a roach for Siri we've got to some she's got to need her own M do you do you need a mount if you can teleport though I yeah yeah how far can she teleport she teleports to like night City for all we know well doesn't gett teleport to he TPS from City to City true true but he hates telor he hates teleporting it was expected Siri would be the protagonist I was a little surprised that it's called The Witcher 4 same um just cuz it's been under code name Polaris all this time and we know that it's starting a new you know a new Trilogy a new story geralt story was ending so I thought maybe it'd be like you know The Witcher colon series big adventure or something like that yeah yeah it feels like it almost makes me think that geralt is in the story in some way still woven into into this new saga and that's why it's called Witcher for it's still it's always been Siri from the beginning but with geralt is still woven in there I was surprised by that too I thought there was going to be a new name for this Saga but I I don't mind it yeah I mean it all just means unfortunately I I don't know anything but he's definitely got a die at some point then right wow I mean you know it's like a mentor to mentee style thing it has to happen it does happen it's a it is a very popular Trope in a lot of story stories in general and I know um I believe Andre sapkowski the um the the author of The Witcher novels I believe he actually just put out a new Witcher novel um I believe it just came out in Poland but hasn't been localized here uh just yet I was just I was patrolling The Witcher 3 subred the other day cuz I got back into the Witcher always a good time to get back into the Witcher I missed the end of that trailer there uh how did you interpret what happened to what the maiden who was going to be sacrificed did she uh do herself in or did someone from her Village do that because she was supposed to be sacrificed to the monster right yeah I I kind of uh saw it as her father presumably being the one to do it because like a sense of politics that The Witcher is known for its kind of like um Grim's fairy tale style thing where you know even though you might have done the heroic thing people just inherently awful and um I think that there's a lot of politics at play whether they be giant tiny Villages or giant castle cities um and I think that's very in line with what The Witcher is known for it is dark fantasy for a reason it's uh tough pills to swallow the game to me it felt like something a message for Siri and like for her to learn that even though she was trying to save this girl there are consequences to changing the way this Village had you know its practices and she went in thinking that she could save this girl and to take down the monster cuz that's what witchers do but that had a consequence and the girl would have Pro probably died either way snaps all around it a very good piece very good uh debut trailer okay we have to take a quick break but before that let's take a look at the next installment in The Killing Floor franchise Killing Floor 3 and when we return we're going to check in with what you all thought

Borderlands 4 split fiction and more but let's see what the folks online are talking about using our Lenovo Le Legion 7i a laptop design for everyday use including live productions like this one the Lenovo Legion 7i features everything you need to gain where you are including a GPU up to an Nvidia RTX 470 14th gen Intel Core I9 processor and 165hz HDR display now our first tweet comes from comes from yam yam iie I think is how I said it right uh finally a brand new game from nauy dog Intergalactic the heretic profit I was low-key tired of hearing the last of us all the time even though it's my favorite game of all time I definitely you know I love the last of us as well but I am so happy to see something new yeah I agreed I think it's refreshing you know you it's always remakes and sequels so it's nice to see new things because people are creative and like making new things it's been over 10 years since it's their last new game The Last of Us right Y in 2013 I believe W 2013 you got it uh following that up we've got at NK doomfist uh Clover is back with a new Okami yeah we're definitely going to get this one I have no words Capcom is cooking tonight Capcom was all over this showcase and I'm very excited Capcom was all over the Showcase no Resident Evil 9 no no Resident Evil 9 other good stuff let's let's talk about okam for a second here this is a huge surprise unexpected to say the least uh I mean I love Okami I love Okami too it just nobody I feel like nobody's thought about Okami since Okami Den which was a DS prequel like what um it looks like it's um kind of uh based on what we saw in that visual again the Okami sequel we don't know what the real name is but it looks like it's still leaning into the Japanese like watercolor art style uh a great news Hideki kamama is back everyone's favorite dude to hate uh Masterpiece Creator Resident Evil 2 uh yeah he's back at Capcom I guess question mark at least working with them on commission by them but I'm excited to see what a dude like Kamya can bring back to uh the Okami Series yeah like you guys said PS2 and DS were the last times we really got Okami obviously we've had remasters or ports to like the wiii and other consoles but with all the new technology and how advanced technology is I am so excited to see what they do with the art in this one because I can do so much more as someone who was not familiar with Okami just watching the trailer for the first time it looked beautiful the waterc collar effects uh Nick here fill me in on the character she's a princess right a mov you were like what's Okami about I was like well you play as like this wolf the embodiment of the Moon God amarazu and then she brings life to the land by running around and making flowers everywhere I think that about that in the watercolor effect in when when you go into the trailer I think it's it's beautiful and it's definitely something that seems interesting to me and uh yeah I can't wait to see what all the hype is about and gameplay Wise It's a Zelda like it's a big like open world Zelda game with Dungeons and stuff like Arena style combat and just a really cool like meta wall breaking uh gameplay mechanic where you use a water brush to like basically seals on demons and stuff um one of my favorite things about Okami as a series is that is very steeped in Japanese like folklore so a lot of like yo-kai that are available a lot of like Japanese ancient myths and things like that you might not be familiar with and it's just fun to learn new things about different cultures yeah yep fun fact about Okami when they ported it to the Wii this is true the box that the game came in the cover the Box had the IGN logo on it they had the watermark but the watermark yeah cuz they grabbed assets from IG an ignan site so at some point so got to love that we're we're part of Okami lore it's true okay what's our next tweet next tweet is from at the Ben star I'm in Tekken 8 Ben star we got cly the voice actor the voice actor for clyve Rosefield from Final Fantasy 16 not Tifa not Tifa I was so close on my my guest but I'm happy we got we got a Final Fantasy character and it fits with their Trend like you said in the pre-show where we got noctis last yeah I mean it's the most recent Final Fantasy and the game is basically a Devil May Cry like so it makes sense that that a fighting game character from a Final Fantasy game is in a fighting game uh also Clive an incredible character and Ben star did a wonderful job voicing Clive and bringing him to life fantastic one day we'll get Master Chief in a fighting game one day we did get a Spartan back in Dead or Alive four that was back in the day but wasn't Master Chief so we're still waiting for he's still waiting for his uh his Smash Brothers letter to come in or invitation uh next up we've got at Wing aide one seamless Co-op Elden ring forget GTA okay big fighting words those are fighting words the wing of fide Came Out Swinging uh I don't know if the the grand community at large is uh going to agree with that sentiment but a lot of people are hyped for Elden ring uh night rain Elden ring night rain should we get into that one yeah let's get into it so I I want to hear what Nick has to say about this I know he's a big Elden ring player but this is something pretty different this is uh very different it looks like it's way more focused around Co-op though you do have the ability to play this single player but not two people but not two people yes it's meant to be enjoyed with friends but one thing that stands out to me is that this is like um like it's it's Elden ring on some sort of performance enhancing drug because it is moving fast and it is intended for you to do dungeon runs within the of 8 to 10 minutes and there's way faster means of traversal I saw some wall climbing I saw some flying and it looks like um I I like was quickly able to glance through what we had written uh I believe we have a big thing up on the site about it but it looks like there's a ring of fire essentially all of fortnite that CL and there's different bosses you can take on I I do you have any more details on it D yeah so Tristan in in Australia he played the game for about six hours so uh he describes it as you take the cautious dungeon crawls of Elden ring and turbocharge them into propulsive slash and dash speedruns and your runs are spread over three days and each day is about 15 minutes long so your run is going to be about 45 minutes long and during each day yeah the map shrinks and it's getting smaller and smaller until you're enclosed in an area and you fight a boss and then if you beat it you go on to the next day and the the ring grows big again you have another day and you spend your day running around trying to find the best equipment and leveling up as much as you can before it's time to fight the boss and everything is randomized with each run so an Elden ring battle royale well Rog like Rog like closer to a Rog likee but yeah and almost more extraction shooter um one thing that stood out to me about that same preview I saw that you don't really build a character you choose from like one of eight different preconfigured classes that all have their kind of unique um strengths and weaknesses but one thing that sounds out to me at first I thought this is just a multiplayer only like there's no story but what we saw that kind of looked like Mel and that looked like a pissed off Melina Allah the end of well well we won't dive too far there but the game's 2 years old at this point if you haven't beaten it it's your own fault uh but from what I've seen uh in this trailer it does look like it takes place post game of Elden ring based on some of the Arenas that we see here and also this dude is that the um the secret boss in Dark Souls 3i the uh what's his face the uh oh the nameless king the namess king is that the nameless King the dude who is the son of the Gwyn from Dark Souls one my lore mind is breaking how are they crossing the streams I don't know how they do this but I'm going to be there day one I cannot wait for Elden ring night rain night rain what who is is there night King as in a rain of Kings yeah not not as in rain falling from the sky what if you fight your Elden Lord that takes your save from your previous Elden ring thing I don't I'm just making stuff that would be F but like there is there is a precedent for taking your save data and using it against you in previous from soft games Allah the nameless Monk and um we see the mimic tier in Elden ring so I'm very excited I don't know if this one's for me I'm more of a single player guy I know you can play it by yourself but you know uh games that are built for multiplayer like hell ders 2 for instance when you play them by yourselves you're in it's just not nearly as good as an experience so I don't know if it's for me but Jada elak what do you think I I mean this is right at my alley I love Challenge and being able to take these things on solo is right up my alley uh I also did a lot of Hell diver solo very lot of stealth runs lot of stealth runs but yeah no this is this looks great I I'm a little worried about the kind of set preset builds and such and how much variety you're going to be able to build and how much versatility you're going to be able to actually make in these runs but I mean fromsoft hasn't really let us down so I'm not going to start doubting them yet so yeah yeah I think on my end I just absolutely love the traditional standard ring experience that I got and that's kind of what I look for when I'm playing single player games I want to take my time I want to explore I want to beat difficult bosses I just want to take my time and this one I might spend my time better playing multiplayer Shooters when it comes to a timed game um so on my end I think it looks pretty exciting I'm going to give it a try for sure because I love Elden ring but I think traditional Elden ring is probably more my style yeah we can't confirm it's not a live service game so once you buy it you get access to the complete Game there's no battle pass no microtransactions or anything like that so that's nice I could see them adding more classes and stuff down the road that seems like something up the up the rally they could do down as time progresses I'm curious how that's going to like how long can you play this game if there's no content that will be coming to it um how how long will it take for you to get tired of it until the next game comes out and is there permanent progression at all like you're keeping anything from run to run you know are you steadily getting more powerful over time you know yeah very curious I mean when you say the three days that it's counting down to I can't help but be reminded of something like Dead Rising and some of the joy of a game like Dead Rising is that you memorize the locations you memorize where things pop up and I think that's part of the like you get kind of the the tetris effect of you get locked in and you just kind of lose yourself in the game going through the motions and just kind of dodging effortlessly and figuring things out and having that be um just like a a memory a mtic uh sort of memory that is you figure out how the game works and you get into the Flow State and I'm excited for hopefully that I don't know we we'll see how it goes well Elden ring night rain is Du out in 2025 the same year that GTA 6 is due as of right now so so we're going to have a third year where Elden ring shows up as a potential like in Awards categories yeah gotta love it they're going for the three Pete the dynasty yeah it's true um let's move on to the next game Borderlands 4 got got a big trailer for this one Borderlands 4 what do we think I really like the Vault Hunters The Vault Hunters that they showed off did not disappoint for me I know some people online were not super excited but I saw some really cool character designs in there some really cool abilities that they started to show off very little bit of that but it looks great there's some mysterious new antagonists that are y you know building an army of Bandits I don't know what to make of that yet but it it's got my my attention mhm I'm not a huge Borderlands guy but one thing that stands out to me is it looks like it's kind of adapting the Borderlands art style for more Modern Hardware I feel like it looks less cartoony in terms of its proportions of its art Direction and looks a lot more um I I think just kind of doubling down on the the the comic book art style while still looking like more like hard sci-fi I don't know it looks interesting to me but ultimately I'm not a huge Borderlands fan except guns go boom lots of guns we had like what a billion gun combinations and guns in Borderlands 3 so we'll see if we get that trillion this time absolutely for me I need to see loot I want loot I want it to be enjoyable to get loot I want loot that is exciting to go get um and I'm hoping that battle uh I was going to say Battlefield hopefully we'll see a battlefield soon um Borderlands for will will give that I I enjoy my loot Shooters as well so it's it's cool to see I also saw some weapons that looked really cool in new Landscapes and yeah I agree with you Nick like it it looks very much like a more modern looking um Borderlands 4 with still keeping a little bit of the classic sty Damon you going to be into this there's pod racing there's pod there's a Pod racer in there now this is Pod racer um I don't know Borland uses a like a stylized art style which works to its benefit the older it gets but every time a new game comes out it still look it kind of just looks the same you know so like I I doubt if if if you put if you cut Borderlands 3 footage in here alongside this I don't know that I would be able to tell the difference you know I did catch a glow on one of when talking about loot um there was a one of the legendary drops that was there in that loot section had this kind of uh magical kind of glow to it at the bottom of it so looks like there could be a new Rarity type of thing added to it or modifiers that are added to those legendary drops so I'm excited to see what that looks like I'll always give a new Borderlands a chance for sure mhm until it disappoints and then then then I'll wait until it's one too many bullet sponges and I'm like all right go back to Borderlands 2 yeah yeah that's right thought one of the funniest trailers uh This Game of Wars was for outer Worlds 2 that was great that was I love the outer Worlds the first one that is Obsidian I think at some of their best writing their best companion creation uh Parvati like that she is one of my favorite NPCs so I'm very excited to see what type of NPCs and companions we get in outer Worlds 2 and you know I they just they're not taking themselves too seriously which I love yeah we'll talk about more uh more about out Worlds 2 in just a minute but first we have to take another quick break before we go let's take a closer look at Dying Light the Beast stick around hi my name is stimon smwa Dying Light franchise director welcome to the Dying Light the Beast trailer break down where I will comment on some of the details and secrets you might have missed in our recent trailer from this year's the game awards Dying Light the Beast is a new Standalone Zombie Adventure in the Dying Light Universe featuring Kyle crane the legendary hero of the first game The Game's narrative connects the stories of Dying Light one and Dying Light 2 stay human and it's set in a moody desolate region called Castor Woods on top of that Dying Light the Beast offers the most evolved version of our gameplay for formula combining natural movement visceral and Savage combat and night and day experience so are you ready to dive deep let's go meet the baron the main antagonist of dying like the Beast he's an emotionless calculating yet brilliant scientist and his real name is Marius Fisher he's the Last Descendant of a noble big farmer Dynasty from cter Woods if you dig deep while playing the game you'll be able to uncover a significant por of the Fisher's family history to better understand The Baron's background the baron held Kyle captive for 13 years performing dangerous and brutal experiments on him why as you can guess Kyle's blood which was exposed to the virus when he was beaten in D one and later to a mysterious substance in the following makes him a very valuable subject for the borrow the scene in the trailer shows one of the experiments on Kyle showcasing his incredible will to survive as he refuses to be The Baron's test subject we wanted to really emphasize Kyle's suffering to better explain his intense thirst for Revenge by the way after working on this Grim scene we wanted to lighten the mood a little so we've hidden a few fun Easter eggs in the medical monitors used in it you will notice the baron surrounds himself with luxurious items for him these prestigious items symbolize his superiority over others his perfect perfectly tyed suit jewelry high-end music equipment and authentic art from Europe's greatest museums were all carefully Chosen and transported to Castor Woods at his demand of course the paintings hold significant meaning reflecting Baron's philosophy and Outlook the same applies to his monologue which references a famous quote from Galileo about Humanity's obligation to use intellect and reason there are quite a few hidden meanings in the trailer so I encourage you to dig even deeper and try to catch them all let's move on to the gameplay portion of the trailer this scene takes place in one of the streets of a tourist town at the center of cter woods the crossbow KY uses in this scene is part of reach and varied arsenal of weapons you'll have In Dying Light the Beast even though Dying Light started as a game focused on melee combat we have consistently added new tools to the pliers brutal Arsenal here we got a glimpse of another new weapon the grenade launcher what's cool about it is that it supports different kinds of ammunition including UV grenades which give you at least some Advantage during the terrifying Nights In Dying like the Beast Dying Light the Beast is set in a region unlike anything we've done before it features a handcrafted High Fidelity open world divided into distinct and diverse areas or biomes as we call them here you can see the swamps a new biome with foggy weather and ankle high water that creates a dark mysterious atmosphere I think anyone can relate to the fear of being alone in the woods at night and that's exactly the kind of experience Dying Light the Beast delivers the Shadows from a flashlight the many trees hiding zombies all of this makes nighttime exploration truly spooky exploration and Discovery are big parts of the experience in addition to the open World areas we have en closed locations like this Example The Baron's laboratory full of horror like atmosphere it is the place where you will encounter a new type of virus the fast moving zombies that Baron is using as soldiers two things we always strive for while developing our games our greater immersion and working closely with the community to meet their expectations here is an example of that initially we planned for car driving to be presented only in third person perspective but based on player feedback we decided to go the extra mile and add a firstperson view as well in Dying Light immersion is crucial engaging with the game World relies on realistic physicality in both the environment and enemies see how a zombie interacts with a wall when thrown against it or how an enemy's body reacts to being pushed onto a railing so you've met the main antagonist the baron you have learned more about ky's desire for revenge and you have caught a glimpse of some of gameplay improvements dying like the Beast brings to the serious but Castor Woods still holds many Mysteries and we can't wait for you to discover them all in summer 2025 thank

you by experts just search for IGN when you search for guides welcome back now in this week's episode of next gen conso watch I asked our audience what they would pick for three of the biggest categories in this year's game awards I personally picked asot his game of the year and look what happened Bano white is aith for the year's best performance and held Evers 2 as this year's best multiplayer title but let's find out what you thought turns out we agreed on all three categories with 35% of the vote going to astrobot 36% to Bro white and 30% to Hell divers 2 was a very close race uh so what do we you think about uh a little bit of a surprise asot winning game of the year it was not a surprise to me I was rooting for astrobot from the beginning I was screaming astrobot sweep although I will have to acknowledge that there were incredible games in that um in that category as well but astrobot I just fell in love with astrobot the the colors the way they took advantage of the controller heptic feedback the Dual sense controller no other game made the PlayStation controller took advantage of the PlayStation controller in that way it just it was just the joy to play this game and also watching the developers create the game they really put a lot of love and passion into it and they were very specific about what they wanted to put into it and it was a complete success bringing the 3D platformer to the modern world and into the hands of new kids also who I've never touched 3D platformer and it's just it's a perfect game it's one of those franchises that I think Sony is going to invest heavily in in the in the coming years we've been talking on numerous podcasts throughout the years where Sony's mascot like characters gone where's the Jack where's the sly where's the ratchet like ratchet's still around thankfully but a lot of other mascots have just kind of like been have disappeared for a while and now Astro is here to kind of fill that void and help help welcome the younger audience into gaming in a I'd say perfect way mhm mhm yeah I mean it is really refreshing I'm I'm I am very surprised that it won game of the year but I am um refreshing it's refreshing that it did because you know there's so many selfs serious AAA gigantic games that look just stunning and they have like super serious story lines and feature mature themes and it's so nice to see that a game that is filled with such pure joy uh walk away with the game of the year because again this is a game distilled down to its purest essence I think it is you run you jump and you zap things like it's it's pretty straightforward but there's so much there to discover and like going back to the PlayStation Roots we saw a little bit with Ash's playroom and now this it feels like Sony is slowly starting to like recognize like hey we used to do weird stuff and uh maybe we should start doing more weird stuff you know any game that has a kid looking at their parent and saying Dad what's Parappa I was like that's a win in my book as far as I'm concerned I mean the game one family Game of the Year also and when you play this game you also see Throwbacks to old games that PlayStation had have launched before so you can enjoy this game as a parent and as a kid at the same time and if you've never seen those characters now you know about them now you can go back and play them so I absolutely love the Nostalgia that th they threw in as a celebration for PlayStation as well it's critical game yeah my 5-year-old son now knows uh jumping flash he thinks jumping flash is cool that's awesome yeah that's a win that's a big win yeah I was surprised I thought I thought Elder ring shadow of the Ury was the favorite win even though I think most people agree it shouldn't be nominated for game of the year but since enough people wanted it to be nominated I thought well you give people the option to vote for it and you assume that they'd vote for it but I don't maybe there was maybe because there was push back for being nominated maybe people Chang their mind okay well for something else instead then yeah and then I thought maybe blo was kind of like a dark horse got a great Underdog Story But then as metaphor kept racking up wi I thought well maybe we're going towards metaphor yeah it's such a crazy that that metaphor I honestly I thought metaphor had it in the bag just because we saw it win so many other Awards like you said and it's such a fantastic game and it came out late enough in the year to where to stay relevant with it being a big massive RPG but it just wasn't its year Astro Astro uh wins all yeah Astro King I think it still had a pretty solid year it did it definitely did and best performance went to the lead from uh Seno Saga hellblade 2 which I know you're a big fan of yes I love the hellblade franchise Molina Jurgens is a fantastic actress her emotions her performance in this it's Ninja Theory has the one of the best map Studios I think for gaming period and so it just really takes full advantage of her her Charisma and her performance and just how great she is at per at portraying uh CA and and although hellblade 2 was shorter than a lot of people would have liked that didn't take anything away from the performance and the story it told it was so powerful and poignant but I I loved it yeah I'm not I don't think u hellblade 2 is particularly like a fantastic game per se but I do think that its focus on telling a cinematic story really did a lot to kind of point at the incredible performance from our lead so I think it just all helped come together to uh basically be a five hour long movie that was just hey look this character rocks and is going through some interesting things and from an AV perspective just the things that they do with audio in that game is nuts and the stuff they do with ue5 just really pushes your Hardware to the Limit yeah like I dream the day when we have a a game that's as fun as Indian Jones in the great circle but has the facial animation of hellblade 2o right like that would be the entire package and then multiplayer game went to hell dver 2ell not too surprising there a lot of fans a lot of people have been very loud they dropped the they announced the new uh faction tonight the illuminate I believe is what they're called it's been a while since I've fought against them since hellers won because they were there in the original and uh yeah I'm hyped to get back in this with the friend group and uh put them on my back once again yeah didn't we also see vehicles in the trailer as well is this the first time that we get vehicles this is the first like team vehicle so there was the armored mechs they had that they dropped a couple months ago which if you did it right with with your allies when you you could get to like a rock face and you could jump on top of the mech and just ride it like Freestyle but uh very dangerous I I don't know how much I'm going to be using the Jeep it's all going to depend on the armor of it because I can just predict especially against the uh automatons that a couple Rockets are going to blow it up and just wipe four off of your lifestock the the new biome as well like the City Escape that's new as well it looks like the illuminate are very much like a zombie horde style situation it well tole and kind of getting tighted and try to figure out how to escape I think of nothing else I'm not a particularly big multiplayer guy but even hell divers 2 was able to kind of pull me into the fold and you know the the beautiful thing about hell divers 2 as a multiplayer game is that everyone walks away with their own bespoke War stories that were theirs and there's alone and that alone is what makes a game like this so special I think it created something that we hadn't seen in a long time like the sense of community and the the memes that came out of it and everybody was role playing in in as they were hell drivers in online I thought I thought it was incredible so I am not surprised that it won a multiplayer game of the year I I talked about it earlier this year on previous game of the year like watch shows and stuff that we did I was like it's all going to depend on if it can keep up that stream of content and they've done a pretty good job of it's had some ups and downs but I think in general in general yeah they kept it relevant yeah congratulations to the winners let's get back to some of the other uh announcements and reveals and new trailers we were talking about outter Worlds 2 earlier uh very amusing latest trailer for that one uh what struck me is that they said they they spent three times as long making the game but it'll be two times as long two times as better two times as big I think as the which is good cuz I loved outer Wilds it but it was kind of you know it was a bit smaller which is not bad you know but the idea of you know spending more time and getting more game out of that is appealing to me I agree this the first outer worlds also had like 500 or 600,000 words of dialogue that I'm sure most people didn't see uh so I am very curious to see how big that the word count is going to be in this one for the narrative and voice acting and such yeah and I think obsidian really shines when they are given like a more intimate setting with a lot more like factions that kind of feed into each other and I think the decisions alone in the first planet of the outer world really set the tone for what the rest of that game would be granted I do think that that game starts way stronger than it ends uh I'm I'm excited to see what obsidian cooking up for outer worlds too because uh bigger is better according to the trailer and I and I agree true we were just congratulating

nice surprise from tonight ninja giden rage bound a new Ninja giden game I am ecstatic and I know a classic 2D pixel art ninja giden so you have to you know they're they're more modern 3D games that is fine by me I grew up with the NES playing Shinobi and the original Ninja guidens back then and or was it just giden back then I can't remember what it was it just ninja giden it was Ninja giden right so yeah I loved those back in the day they were very difficult very challenging it's all it's all at my alley and I'm just very eager to see what this fully brings to the table yes this comes from the uh the team behind the Blasphemous games oh which already has incredible pixel art right so Blasphemous pixel art with Ninja giden classic ninja giden gameplay that sounds like a a good combination to me yeah I unfortunately stepped away to use the restroom when this was announced and I came back and we were like ninja guide and ninja guide was like no what did I Miss so U but but again I got caught up to speed that the little anime cut scene here looks incredible and the fact that it's coming from the dev behind Blasphemous and blasphemous 2 music to my ears Masters who know Metroid Vania like the back of their hand and just look at this gameplay this looks like classic nin silky smooth and there just platforming hell it looks like you're juggling things acrobatic nonsense it looks like it's going to be tough and fun and I cannot wait to uh potentially grip and break through controllers as I make my way through the game I'm very curious what IGN's Mitchell Saltzman is thinking of this cuz he's been asking for a new Ninja Guiden for I don't know the last three or four like years and it's it's finally coming yeah so the the original NES games are just known for being just brutally difficult the 3D games went deeper with uh with uh Combos and you know attacks it's just a deeper a deeper combat system also unforgiving yeah but they're saying they're sort of marrying the they're bringing that deeper combo or deeper combat system to the classic 2D gameplay which could be cool I'm okay with that also sounds like we're not playing as Ryu because it says this is the official description Our Story begins when Rio hyabusa Journeys to America to honor his father's will while he is away the barrier between the human and the Demon World suddenly shatters unleashing a terrifying Army upon the Hayabusa Village which now faces an unprecedented threat in R's absence to stand against this new threat Kenji mozu a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village Rises to the challenge just shows that you just can't take vacation in 2024 2025 this point you I mean the good news is Kenji is sporting a blue uh outfit which is always very cool so very hype for the blue outfit it's also reminiscent of the original NES style if I remember correctly alak what's your level of interest in like retro style you know 2D action games like this you'll catch me in shovel KN that's about it is great I'm happy for you guys Shel n is great um a few of us are already already ready to declare game of the year 25 being slay the Spire 2 let's go slay the Spire 2 looks incredible we finally got gameplay of it um it I saw like you got a party member uh in it from what I saw and again it looks like there's going to be a lot of those branching paths where you have to decide whether or not you want to take certain things sacrifice certain things and again the beauties of all things Rogue like I cannot wait for slay the Spire to it the original slay of spire has claimed so much of my life already on multiple platforms I buy the game on every new platform avilable on and then Pro proceed to spend hundreds of hours every single time so uh please don't do this to me but I'm also very excited I love the updated design for the characters like the silent that we've SE that we've seen in the past I love that we're getting a new Necromancer style class I missed the name I think it's like necrom or something like that that looks really cool I a new automaton style uh hero as well from what I saw yeah I've got I don't know like 500 hours on this on PlayStation and PC and this is EAS going to do the same thing when it hits Early Access next year yep Early Access next year please be excited okay Haz Light Studios just announced the new game split fiction and IGN got to sit down with the game director Joseph Ferris we'll have a snippet of that interview for you live right here you can catch the full interview on IGN but first we've got an exclusive new look at AI limit an upcoming Souls likee RPG from developer sense games let's check it out [Music] and we're back excuse us while uh sort out some tech difficulties lots more games to talk about though I just mentioned split fiction let's talk about that this is the new one from Haight Studios and Joseph the latest Cooperative action game and I think it looks really cool it is such a Marvel to see the evolution of Haz Light Studios games I sat down with Joseph Ferris way back in the day for a way out and play that co-op with him for a short while during an interview and I would I walked away just excited to see how that how it was going to grow and with it takes 2's great design and just really great use of different genres in gameplay split fiction looks like it's up the antie even further I I'm very excited for this and it looks like it's going to have a bunch of real crazy things that we get to play as the two protagonists two women who get stuck in some sort of both no I believe okay they're no but they're stuck in some sort of like virtual reality like a simulation yeah my my my my take on the story from what I understood from the trailer was they're going to the studio to like kind of pitch this thing they're supposed to each hop in their own VR kind of VR bubble that like simulates it and the studio tries to steal them something happens they get popped in the same bubble and now they're trying to get back out yeah and one likes sci-fi one likes fantasy so they're bouncing back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy worlds yeah I mean it takes to kind of blew my mind with how generous it was in terms of always giving you something new to do the game shifted genres dramatically one second you're doing a platforming challenge the next you're uh doing a street fighter style fighting game and it's always fun it's always entertaining the entire time and I thought surely there's no way they could do it again and it seems like they are uh he seems to have doubled down on his promise saying every single thing will be new as you evolve from level to level and right now it is very clear that you go to a fantasy land you go to a Sci-Fi land but something tells me they're going to get mixed up along the way so you might be a knight in a cyberpunk city at some point which is always going to be ripe for such a fun setting so very stoked to see what he does and dude he's funny I think he's got a great sense of humor and I think that the games really show I like how he is sharing one level he says you starts with two dragons hatching and they're baby dragons at first but eventually they'll become full ass dragons full ass dragons so Damon you're a Metroid fan right oh yeah how do you how do you feel about the like the going into morphball that that was my initial thought with that too so yeah that looks great split fiction okay we do have ai limit and our interview ready to go so I'm going to hand you over to them right now enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey life SS game was finally revealed and the co-op mashup of fantasy and sci-fi is set to take over your gaming platform of choice early next year and the founder of Haz light Joseph Ferris is here with me to share more about what we can expect you have unpaid parking tickets time to die excuse me run we we saw the trailer at the game awards for split fiction so Joseph I need you just tell us a story what what is a story that we can experience as Gamers well it's about uh two girls named named Mi and Zoe like my daughters they're also named me and Zoe it's not based on their personalties because they're just four and two it's just a nice thing to have and these two uh strangers that they don't know each others are two amateur writers who uh gets to this new tech company that can simulate your story to life and they get there in hope of getting published and like you know releasing their story to to to the world but when they you know go sideways and and one of the characters Mo like suspect something's not you know right uh and accidentally she ends up in zo's simulation like in the same pod because they're totally different people different strangers they end up in the same simulation and they have to work together to escape the simulation the thing is though one right sci-fi on the otherwise fantasy and you have to play like a every sci-fi level and every fanty for every for every level so it changes all the time like from sci-fi to Fantasy for every level and the thing is like they're not a fan of each other's genre every story of of the tells something about them as characters as well so they kind of like you know criticize their stories and stuff like that so it's going to be a really crazy ride yeah so so the name kind of makes sense then split fiction so we got sci-fi elements and we got fantasy elements now I'm someone who really I love both of those aspects so um and what you know looking at the the game play it's quite the variety oh yeah it's quite like it looks like there's some sides scrolling elements as well that that are thrown in there there man this is what Haight is a b we love variety if you look at our games I mean even like the first one like brothers look at there's always like been something that I've been pushing for a lot like having variety otherwise you know you need this it feels very repetitive but we we have pushed it to the next level with our games I mean we did it it takes to this one is even crazier I mean I'm telling you it's crazy there's so much vary in it I mean we have like we have first our main levels then we have something like we call like side stores that's kind of side con you can miss and those are literally 5 to 10 minutes of like new worlds you know with set pieces bosses sometimes like a total new crazy stuff that that you experience and that's something actually the player can miss so make sure to play those as well I want to walk back a little bit because I want to talk about uh the inspiration for this game um obviously it's it's it's two writers who whose lives become entwined um and they got to try to get out of this so what what was the inspiration what what you know because I know you had like how many drafts of this cuz you you teased this like the the the draft on on Twitter a while back I'm kind of curious what what was the inspiration for this for this story well look the inspiration always at is like the pushing to the next like what can we do stuff that we haven't done before like trying to like uh you know see the like creatively what can we take to the next level and and and and really in the beginning it was really cool and I can't go into details exactly what the first idea that popped in the head was but what I can say is that it was switching between the Sci-Fi and fancy felt really appealing felt like oh that's something that haven't really been done before like this like how and you're going to see listen to me like if if you play the game I guarantee you and come to the end and I can guarantee you you will see stuff that you have never seen in a video game before now I know I sound cocky but I can guarantee you and if not come to me and I'm going to hold you to those words my I I I'm going to hold you to that I guarantee you will see stuff that you haven't not seen before okay and if I don't yeah if I don't I'm going to knock on your door I'm going to find out where you live I'm going to sit down with me and play it with you until they understand wait about it okay cool no y'all heard it here first this is this is being recorded so we're going to we're going to revisit this do year this camera this one this one I'm in let's do it I got to ask you though which one of your games this is my final final question which one of your games do you think would be uh best for a movie to adapt into a movie I I think a way out I think if you if you if you take this script and like a you know make it a really good feature film I think it could be really nice you know there are some talks that they want to do but Hollywood is so much Bull and talk we'll see if it ever happens but if it happens I think it's going to be great movies yeah I think I I I'd love to see it yeah yeah yeah yeah well Joseph I want to thank you so much for your time make sure to play split fiction and trust me when I say this in the end you've seen some you been playing something that you've never played before I guarantee you this let's shake on that yes I'm going to hold you to that please do please do and and for for everyone watching what's the release date it's

now we're winding down here for the night but before we go Wonder how we would how we would rate this year's lineup of announcements on the iGun scale because I think it was pretty strong this year Jay how would you rate it o I think I we were talking about it beforehand I said I was I was I believed it was going to be a seven I think so yeah I think I'm going to revise that to an eight I think it was a very solid it was a very great show there was a lot of things that I liked there was a couple things I just didn't really care for but overall I got some of the things I wanted to see so I'm happy mhm Nick you no we didn't get halflife three uh this isn't going to be a nine or a 10 out of 10 but I think I'd have to stick with an eight I believe it was a great show uh putting together these giant things is uh very difficult um it's hard to make it cohesive and legible you know not everything appeals to everyone but I think that Jeff and his team did a fantastic job of making a show with a little something for everyone um I think it started incredibly strong with Witcher 4 and Elden ring back to back um and I think it ended very strong with uh stuff likei Sequel and Intergalactic but again it even had some like strange things I didn't expect to see like onam Musha which we didn't even talk about onam Musha oh man onam Musha and slay the Spire too again I can't I can't sing the Praises of slay the Spire 2 enough yeah yeah I think I give it an eight right I I don't remember what rating I gave up before but I think I'm going to taking it down to a seven on my end I I was it started strong you know with Witcher I absolutely expected to see Witcher we got Elden ring um we also got Tac which was a surprise to me I absolutely loved T Roo so it's great that they're bringing that back to 2025 um but then we didn't get death stranding we didn't get any updates on OD we didn't get to see Resident Evil 9 we also didn't get to see the 007 Hitman project um so there's a few games that were question marks that I truly believe were going to show themselves here in the game awards that I didn't get to see so it's still strong show really cool games that we got to see but I was wishing for a little bit more yeah I thought it was strong I'm going to go old school IG and give it a 7.9 W just to shake things up do you know what pushed it up to an eight for me Damon what's that it was flute guy and kear man they they were great they were fantastic guy can play anything if you can if you can he can play a lot of different instruments he was dual wielding like he was hot the cool down on the flute was kicking off so he swapped to something else I don't know how he does it yeah um we mentioned Resident Evil 9 not being there were there any other um surprise surprising games that were not there like Monster Hunter wild I was really hoping to see more Monster Hunter Wilds but we did just get this massive beta that happened just a couple weeks ago it's out in February into February so I'm not mad I just I'm just greedy and I wanted more Monster it's just it was the greediness in me yeah I'm pretty shocked we didn't like uh LX said I'm really surprised we didn't get anything from coima uh usually he takes up a lot more age time uh I'm honestly kind of baffled we didn't get a releasee for I said during rehearsals there there is a great chance we do not get a rehearsal announc soon can mean anything do you think do you think coima is afraid of Grand Theft Auto 6 too oh yes oh man yeah they're much smaller Studio than that's true very true I thought we were going to see some Doom I thought so too see any Doom that's an early 2025 game when is it when is it coming out we don't have a release for it I wanted to see Doom Slayer you know Doom guy kicking some butt but no I was hoping for a little more G of yote as well just a little little more tease of that one yep y would have been great to see a little bit more of that uh but I mean we got a great first trailer from them so I'm not I'm not mad about not getting more of it and I'd said I thought we might see civ7 we got a musical performance of it so it it appeared participation award it it did get a participation com soon enough though yeah that's February as well February is going to be a massive month for games between Civ Monster Hunter Assassin's Creed something else just got moved into February as well that I cannot remember jez but yeah uh surprise of the show for me uh project Century the new RU game set in like Tao era uh Japan that looks sick how are they making so many games and that's definitely not an asset recycle they've got uh like a pirate like a dragon pirat in pirates in Hawaii inw yep and then they did this project Century but then they also oh the other one was Virtual Fighter they're doing a virtual fighter game which I believe they have a presentation on going right now I think I think it might have just ended it was like I think right at the end for like 30 minutes or so but or maybe it is going on right now but Tao era Japan is not a setting we get to see often um I think if for all the anime fans out there Demon Slayer is set in the TA show era Japan but a game set in there that's really exciting what do you think the game is is it a yaku it looks like a akaku are like just set in a different era of Japan which I appreciate because that's such an interesting setting yeah I was like before they announced it I was like are we getting a like throwback Sleeping Dog somehow may maybe w i loved Sleeping Dogs back in the day I was like this is kind of kind of those vibes kind of just kind of run going around through a city I was like this would be a good time to bring it back you mentioned uh he mentioned uh interesting settings and it just reminded me of Mafia did they did they really say 1900s or yeah he said 1900s yeah so strange early 20th century early 20th century uh 1900s Sicily which I thought was really cool to be able to see that like the beginnings or the prequel of the criminal underworld there in Italy like that's that's pretty cool yeah I'm excited to explore that one too and then you mentioned onimusha that was one of the few games that was announced for 2026 yeah deep teas not coming 2025 I actually never played onimusha tell me why I should be excited uh onam Musha is a ancient feudal Japan resident um so if you like original Resident Evil it was very much just Resident Evil set in ancient Japan with cool demons and puzzles um but this one looks like it's borrowing a lot from the likes of something like Neo um it looks a lot more action oriented combo heavy um it looks like you know I I would assume it's taken a little bit more than some inspiration from stuff like SEO Shadows di twice and you know in an era where we are seeing more action games set in um like ancient Japan or China Alla Phantom Blade zero uh I'm just excited to see like a PS2 hardcore style action game uh Beyond Modern Hardware uh granted the original onusa wasn't quite that U but I think it's definitely eeking towards that direction more uh in a modern setting all right well I look forward to 2026 yep and checking out the latest on Musha and I think that about does it for this year's game awards uh post show right here on IGN thank you to my wonderful panelists to all the people hard at work behind the scenes

The 86"" LG Ultra Stretch Digital Signage Display has an aspect ratio of 58:9, making it relatively wider than just about any other display we've tried to game on. How well does it game? The answer is more interesting than you might think, and depends much more on how the game was made than when.

With just 600 vertical pixels, no support for HDR, and a pedestrian 60 Hertz refresh rate, it's meant more for digital signage than for gaming. But when we saw this on Facebook Marketplace, we knew we had to try it anyway. Widescreen gaming was particularly challenging in the early days, but... Even now, some games struggle beyond the standard widescreen aspect
ratio of 16:9. So, you must be asking yourself, how are they gonna handle
something that is 3.6 times wider? Look at that high fidelity graphics there. Wow. As you just saw, in some cases, disastrously, but in other cases,
surprisingly well. And a shocking number of games, even ones that are older than the
last 5, 10... ...or even 20 years, were able to handle this aspect ratio with a
relatively clear, unstretched picture. Like this relatively clear and unstretched segue to our sponsor. War Thunder. Experience pure vehicle combat immersion thanks to
over 2,000 true-to-life war machines to control and wreak havoc with. Click the link below to score some bonus items too. First up, I just want to say you guys outdid yourselves with the
setup here. We wanted to illustrate just how wide this thing was and Tanner not
only grabbed... the widest desk pad available at LTTStore.com, but also built a
keyboard. Oh no, I didn't build this. This was built by... I forget the guy's
name. The company name is Pikatea. He did a limited run of these and actually sent us his personal
prototype. At a pixel count of 3840 by 600, it's a little over one quarter of
a slice of a 4K display, making this a very unusual piece of digital signage. But what makes a display ""signage"" instead of a... ""TV"" or a ""monitor""? Well, for one thing, the price. Instead of costing in the 30 to 40 cents per square inch range, like a basic monitor or a TV, this costs over $3.50 per square inch. That's about eight times more. So while the actual screen area of this is less than that of a commodity 55-inch TV, it costs 4,000 US dollars. Now... I could tell you that, oh, but that's because they use a special
panel technology or exotic screen coatings or something like that.
but unfortunately, that would be a lie. It uses the same fundamental IPS
panel tech that you've seen from LG Display for decades with, at most, some more
resilient driving electronics in order to handle a heavier duty cycle and,
probably more importantly, a warranty that covers commercial use. So why does it cost so much? Well, there's the warranty support, but also a handful of features
that provide meaningful value to businesses, but that consumers don't
necessarily need, so LG can hold them ransom if you don't pay the signage tax,
like the robust support for picture-by-picture, picture-in-picture, the support
for control over serial, control over network, various signage network
protocols, and support for both DisplayPort input and DisplayPort passthrough. That last feature pairs really well with Simplink, which is a
protocol for connecting you directly to the wallet of your audience on Twitch. I'm just kidding. Simplink is pretty much CEC and allows multiple
daisy-chained displays to be controlled with a single remote. Oh, and I would say the software is another area of improvement. Would you look at that? The same webOS you know and love, except
completely devoid of ads. It's got other cool stuff too, like input failover, the ability to export and import settings so that if you need to reset the device, you don't have to fool around and tediously adjust every setting in every sub menu. And it can even send you an email if something goes wrong. So if all that sounds great and you really want one of these, we're gonna have it linked below like we always do, but enough chit chat, let's see how it games. Oh my God, the ergonomics of this setup are not great. It's a lot of blank space. I went into the display modes 'cause I was noticing there was a lot of motion blur. Yeah. And I was thinking, oh, is there a gaming mode? No, but if I need transportation mode or a government mode or mall mode, those are conveniently available for me. I like transportation mode. Let's do it. Makes it look like you're on a bus. That didn't change much, it's a little warmer. I gotta say this pixel density, not great. Nope. It's not fantastic. You can really make out the individual pixels. 'Cause this would be equivalent to probably what? Like a 75, 86 inch TV if it wasn't just all long? No, no. No, no, because 86 inches corner to corner, 84 times whatever, 16 divided by nine times 84, a number. Pixels per inch is 46. So what's a 27 inch 1080p monitor? 81. 81. Ah, and that's already at the lower end of what I would want to use for desktop use. Okay, well that explains it. That's not even as distorted as I kind of thought it would be. He looks so lonely though. There's no doubt that when you're this close to it and you're focused on what would be the normal size of a monitor, it not only looks fine, but it actually is a little bit more immersive. However. When you withdraw a little bit and pay attention to just how distorted things get toward the edge of the frame. Look at my buddy here. I'm doing battle next to wide Putin. Did you see that scoping? Actually kind of immersive. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, get, get, get out of here. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Overall, I think the most remarkable thing about this game is how unremarkable the process was to get it working. I launched it and it immediately worked. Is it providing a great gaming experience? No, not really, but the problems that I'm having are mostly related to its mediocre specs. I mean, 60 Hertz, slow pixel response times, not to mention that this menu right now is about 600 by approximately 1,000 or 1,100 pixels. You can barely read the text. The widescreen element of it in games has held up pretty well, but that wasn't always the case. Even though widescreen displays became readily available in the latter half of the 1990s, due to their price, they failed to reach any kind of mainstream acceptance for, well, quite a few years, and game support over those years has been spotty at best. Fun trivia fact, by the way, legendary developer John Carmack is known for using the Intergraph Interview 28HD96, a $10,000, 100-pound 16:9 CRT that he purchased in 1996 to work on
Quake II, which ended up looking pretty decent on our 58:9 display. Is it because it was designed for a widescreen? Yes, but also no. It's definitely stretched, but... If it were only designed for 4:3 and 16:9, the image would be far
more stretched than it is. Instead, the game renders in a scalable manner, so it doesn't
really care what resolution you run at. And this approach probably seems like common sense today, but many
older games were designed with a fixed aspect ratio and, well, didn't do so well. ""Do, do, do, do, do, do... do, do, do, do, do..."" ""Do, do, do..."" Damn it. I believe I was expected to notice something. Yeah, you're also expected to get further into the game. Hey, hey, hey, hey, look, look, I... Oh, oh, no way. Whoa, what? This is a standard ROM. It's the emulator itself that's doing things differently. Okay, when the enemies start just appearing out of nowhere, six feet in front of you, and you're not expecting it as much. Okay, so it's just caching whatever the last thing we saw was statically then. It's not actually dynamically updating anything that's going on on the left, on the non-focused parts of the window. And you can actually get a good idea of when the sprites are actually being rendered and kind of how everything is laid out this way. And it actually numbers the total, what like background draws or like scenes, or now we've got the entire level stretched out behind us. And this NES emulator shows the issue of converting 2D tile-based graphics to widescreen. The picture is going to get rendered as a whole picture with the
sprite images being stored in the character memory and the level layout being stored on the program memory. In order to change the size of the view, the entire process needs
to be changed to accommodate for this new size. When you've only got 32 kilobytes
of program memory, 8 kilobytes of character memory, and just 2 kilobytes of RAM, keeping size down is absolutely critical. You can't Add in code to make it widescreen if that would mean removing a
level or a feature. So the easiest way to convert a 2D game to run in this super
wide aspect ratio is to just fake it. This is not in fact the original Super
Mario Brothers, but rather a complete remake that is being rendered in our web
browser and doesn't use emulation or even sprites. Instead, everything that
you're looking at is a scalable vector. So . I'm sorry, but you can't just throw any old ROM at this thing and
see the whole level. Now that doesn't mean that it's impossible to adapt real
old 2D games to widescreen. It's just... harder. Anyway, there's a ROM hack of Super Mario World for the Super
Nintendo made for 16:9 that successfully injects code for widescreen support,
but such a change would need to be done for every game individually or your only
option would be to stretch. Thankfully, during the shift from 2D to 3D, scalable rendering like
we saw in Quake 2 became the norm, even in places where the resolution was
expected to remain constant. Take the PSP, for example. While later models do have a TV out
feature, the launch model could only play games on its own screen so there was
technically no need for the developers of early titles like Ridge Racer to make
their graphics scalable to any aspect ratio, but thanks to the power of
emulators. We should be able to get it rendering in 58 by nine anyway. So we've got our PSP emulator open here and-- I have never used a PSP emulator. They have some fun features and they can just do full screen like this. How do I even line up which thing I'm changing? Yardstick maybe? Oh. Oh yeah, there you go. Okay, V-sync. Okay, do we want that on? And now you'll see that the car looks correct. Yeah. Everything else looks wrong, but the car looks correct. And that's the difference between 2D and 3D there. So any asset that is just built at a fixed pixel count is gonna look terrible. And anything that was built using scalable graphics actually is gonna look, I mean, overall, it looks shot. That speedometer though. Overall, this is not nearly as horrible as I would have expected though. Bomberman would be amazing on this. I think we are going to cover the history of Bomberman and Ultra Wide Screen in the Floatplane exclusive. LMG.GG/Floatplane. You see we've got a couple different cheats here. We've got PSP 16x9, Ultra Wide, Super Wide, and then I've added my own Stupid Wide here. Yeah. Go to actually edit cheat file here. Yeah. We can see we've got a couple different cheats here. Now, the first part is the section in memory we want to change. So in this case, this memory holds. just the aspect ratio. Oh, very cool. The second number is a hexadecimal of the aspect ratio itself. So in our case, we've got 6.4 because it's 58 divided by nine. Yep. That's basically how this and a bunch of other consoles just handle aspect ratio. It's one spot in memory. It's the result of dividing the big by the little, the width by the height. Anyway, the point is for years, the PC side of things was full of similar half implementations of scalable graphics. And while many modern games have been designed in anticipation of weird resolutions, like on a Microsoft Surface or on one of these, older titles are full of issues during the transition years from square to wider displays, issues that will obviously be hilariously exaggerated on this thing. Oh no. It's a good thing the doors in this hospital are super wide, otherwise I would have no hope of fitting through them. Oh my God, this car. It looks like six people are sitting abreast here. ""Hitman: Blood Money"" supports widescreen, but you would never know it from the ultra cinematic view of the cut scenes. Nor would you know it from the configuration menu. The issue in this case, and in many, is that the developer just couldn't be arsed to expose the option to the user. So it supports the resolution, but there's actually nowhere to change it in this menu. And this isn't because it was necessarily a ton of extra work to add those options, but it's because any added features. It's gonna add development and testing time, both of which cost money. And money is a thing that the corporate overlords are not quick to spend unless they absolutely have to. So in the early days of widescreen, it basically came down to how many people are gonna be using one like this? Enough to bother? Oh, well then forget it. I also couldn't help noticing that this particular game appears to be a vertical minus game. Rather than a horizontal plus game. Even though everything is rendered proportionally accurately, we can't see for sh*t. We just have a slice of about a third to a quarter of what we
should be able to see. Before you ask, by the way, yes, there is a configuration menu
outside of the game, but as you can see, that's not gonna help us. No. To get help, we're gonna need a site like Widescreen Gaming
Forum. . They were a godsend back in the day, and while they're kinda dead
now, they were an invaluable resource for hacking your way into widescreen
gaming bliss. Sometimes literally. Lara Croft in The Guardian of Light is an excellent example of
this. A registry edit might not be a ""hack"" in the literal sense, but as
someone who went through the frustration of trying to get my beloved older games
working on my new widescreen gaming monitor, it definitely ""feels"" a little like hacking the Gibson when you
finally see everything load up and you're like, ""aww yeah!"" And the same goes for the classic .ini edit. Many games have a configuration file that tells the game which in-
game settings to use by default. For games that had engine level support, but just didn't expose the
option for a widescreen resolution in the menu, this was often, not only, the only solution, but also a pretty easy one. And fun fact, by the way, if you ever accidentally configure your game settings on a modern game, just ignoring the whole widescreen thing, into an unusable state, say you turned on DirectX 12 combined with some other setting that I still haven't figured out in Anno 1800, well, you can go into the .ini file and fix it, launch the game again, and then go back to your trial and error. Now, not all of these hacks were so not actually hack. And in fact, some games like Lara Croft and the
Temple of Osiris required the user to replace the executable itself with a modified one,
hopefully downloaded from a trusted source in order to add widescreen functionality. That threshold of
trust was up to you to decide. And I think 2024 me probably would have told 2007 me to be a bit
more prudent. I also would have told myself that sometimes it is just plain not worth it. See, there are two possible ways for a game to scale your view when trying to accommodate a super wide monitor. It can extend the horizontal view like we saw with our racing games. And actually it looks like Temple of Osiris extends horizontally. Or if the engine doesn't support it or the game's own implementation doesn't support it, it can just shrink your vertical view to match your aspect ratio like we saw in Hitman: Blood Money. Oh, apparently we get to play another game like that now. Oh boy, this doesn't seem like the kind of game that should do that. Yep, that's definitely a problem. I mean, obviously there's an argument against just seeing an endless expanse of water to the side of this island that we're all fighting over. But on the other hand, I can't even see the context of anything below me. I can't zoom out. That's maximum zoom. This isn't only a problem in games either. There are folks out there who have started collecting DVDs again, just so they can see visual gags that were lost when their favorite shows went widescreen for online streaming, like that famous Duff beer gag on ""The Simpsons."" I think ""Seinfeld"" has some really bad ones as well. Here's what I'm talking about, the episode called ""The Pothole."" You can't see ""The Pothole"" if you watch ""Seinfeld"" on Netflix. As bad of an experience as this is in your TV shows or games though, it can be even worse. In a game menu. Now, this is an issue that is obviously accidental and honestly doesn't come up that often, but with this particular display being only 600 pixels tall, the fact that menus have a minimum height in order to be usable is something not to be overlooked. Borderlands, in fact, plays just fine once you can get into the game, but in order to do that, well, you're going to have to, I don't know. Look at this. See, I can't move my mouse above options. So I just need to, ah, yes. Use the keyboard to navigate and either have a picture for reference or have memorized how many clicks. Maybe that one. Ah. Oh no. A common but thankfully less game-breaking widescreen implementation issue is aspect-locked FMV videos. These show up in games where otherwise the support is perfectly fine and the game is perfectly playable, but you reach a point in the story where it's time for a little bit of exposition or dialogue, and all of a sudden, either the aspect ratio shrinks to 16:9 or, heaven forbid, 4:3, or, worse than that, it takes a pre-baked scene and then just stretches it across your
entire screen. Thankfully, all it really does is break immersion, and it's
improved a lot in recent years, but it does still show up quite a lot. Of course, just because a game supports any resolution and avoids
the dreaded vert-minus-view syndrome doesn't mean that it's going to be without
issues. Parkitect, for example, looks great. Very playable, except, oh my
goodness, my UI is so far away that I'm having difficulty reading it. It's playable, it's not the end of the world, but when HUD and UI elements are anchored to the sides of the screen, they can end up so far out of view that in order to see them, you have to completely take your eyes off the action in the middle of the screen. And while it might seem impossible for anyone in their right mind to be using a 58 by nine monitor, in fact, NVIDIA Surround and iFinity setups using three 16 by nine monitors are pretty common and they form a view that is awfully similar to ours
just with bezels down the middle. One iFinity League of Legends modder went
so far as to build a tool that moves the HUD over from the sides of the screen and then resizes it
to the user's liking. The tool has been long abandoned but it was a great idea and a feature that
really should be baked into more games. There are a number of hacky tools that gamers have used
over the years to fix widescreen issues like custom resolution utility but there are too
many for us to demonstrate all of them today. Fortunately, it's far less of a problem these days and most games won't outright break if you try to launch them on weird resolution monitors. But it's obvious from a game design standpoint that it's just not possible to offer a perfect experience at every display size and shape. Oh, here's an example. On the first level of this game, you've got the farmer, right? Yeah. Or the gardener. And there's a lot of times where the camera wants to attach the gardener and it can actually move the goose outside of the view of the camera. It doesn't really cause any major issues, but you end up moving the goose around without it being on screen, which can become very confusing very quickly. It's clear that there's just games that aren't gonna benefit from a super wide monitor and are gonna look kind of silly if you have one. Yeah, I don't think I would choose an ultra, ultra, ultra wide monitor to play this game. You're not always given the choice. Some modern games don't support ultra wide resolutions for gameplay reasons. Starcraft 2 isn't the most recent example, but it's a very famous one of a game that supports various aspect ratios and resolutions, but no wider than 16 by nine in order to prevent owners of ultra wide monitors from getting a greater view of the battlefield, giving them a competitive advantage. This has been a source of considerable frustration for owners who are sick of looking at blank spaces on the edges of their match, especially when other competitive Blizzard games do support the feature. So in summary, monitors and TVs, they're probably wide enough at this point. And even for digital signage, we honestly had a hard time coming up with any use for this thing. We were thinking maybe like a menu for the concession at the badminton center or something, but like it's so skinny and the resolution sucks. So wanna buy the widest monitor? No? How about something from our sponsor? War Thunder. What could be more satisfying than watching large
vehicles get destroyed in a video game? Maybe watching over 2,000 vehicles get destroyed? War Thunder is a free-to-play PvP with a focus on realism. The combat is immersive, with every tank, plane, and ship being
modeled after their real counterparts, right down to how it feels to pilot them and the sounds they make. There's a game mode for everyone, from the casual to the most
hardcore players. One of the cooler features is the damage x-ray view. When you destroy an enemy vehicle, you can see where the damage was
done, how it affected the vehicle, and what ultimately led to your
victory, making strategizing for the next time easier. So join over 70 million players from around the world and start playing War Thunder free today at the link below. If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe check out our video on the
Samsung Odyssey Arc. It is absolutely huge and maybe somehow less impractical than this
monitor. What are we doing with this thing? Okay, it's for sale."

People accuse us of being out of touch. How much does a banana cost? $10?!? Today, we're pitting our tech tipsters against each other in a Gaming PC Build-Off using only their knowledge. That’s right, they need to build a $1000 PC without checking the internet for pricing. Do they know the price of each GPU off hand? What about RAM? CPU?

well there's a catch we need the highest possible performance but we can't go over budget and we're not allowed to check the internet for pricing oh well that is a lot harder then I guess the pressure's on to tell you about our sponsor ug green check out their cute and compact Uno magnetic power bank it features status emojis and up to 15 watts of wireless charging with a 36w hour capacity check it out at the link in the video [Music] description all right Lads the rules are simple one build the best one ,000 PC from anything on these shelves two no help from the internet and three a few other restrictions that I sent out yesterday any questions don't care go I think we go big GPU yeah 100% am4 am4 for sure I don't care about case just something cheap and decent probably like a Chinese brand big risk but I want to go 7900x we going to way overshoot this budet some of them are really cheap how cheap like 500 bucks do we want to waste money on CPU or just stock it 3 okay and fractal mesh each team has their plan and now it's time to select all of our parts we're going to do a snake draft order starting with Team literal arson we have 45 seconds per part let's go okay go go let's go go 7800 XT not the XTX well we could go for a fancy with 7800 no we need to go the cheapest shiest looking one the gigabyte looks expensive I was hoping for something that seems cheaper looking we got to pick we got to pick 79 gr where next we next I don't know try it two do this we got we have our part okay do we want 12 or 13 12 might be cheaper like we could do 12400 do we have a 12400 oh [ __ ] a lot of 13 6ks oh my God we don't have any of the ones that I'd want where are all the CPUs g g is not as good not as good holy sh 13400 13100 they're going 79 doeses that make they're going way over budget 77 uh 7900 7800 XT that's a maybe 77 that's 7700 XT XT XT okay yeah we're good on that we're good on that CPU CPU CPU I really would rather go with this unless we want to go Intel 3 4 okay okay B 660 B 660 650 650 oh Jes oh Jesus Christ oh and this said A1 oh no no this is ITX oh God uh here this is reasonable Asus no no this one this one all right it's our turn go all right way all right yelling all right I'm looking for motherboards am4 where the freak is it right here do you think b450 Pro four good I think that's fine all right that's probably 100 bucks okay okay but we get to go again right yeah okay basically all they have AMD wise that's like reasonable right I really don't know I think it'd be safer just to go with like this yeah that is this one that's probably the best choice yeah we're going to go with the 5600 G 6900 XT or 7900 XT or 78 or 78 I think 78 78 is the one this looks like some pretty awful stuff should we just go for it or theam what let's do [Music] it I can't I have what I want I just can't get it out what did you just do what does this require it's pretty chunk dude it's pretty chunk it is pretty chunk oh my [ __ ] we're screwed we we're so screwed now that the major components have been selected we're going to round out our systems with ram case power supply Etc until we get to the most important category Flex item I need to find out if there's fans that are included with this or not so that we want to use our FX pick for fans real quick oh God it's back no no fans so get fans okay this looks good this all work let's cheap RGB would be really good it's going to be so expensive though it's going to be really expensive I want something silly alija we can have this for $10 done the parts have been selected our Fates have been sealed now it's time to build starting with Team arson for our CPU we ended up going with the 5600 G and I think we ran into the same issue a lot of the other teams did which is when they looked in the pile of AMD CPUs all of them were already checked out either to another project or Labs testing I don't know how much these are worth now I have literally no clue I want to say 15 bucks I put down 125 as my guess I'm feeling a little bit sick to my stomach the fact that the first component is different than I thought it was I thought we just got a regular 13100 but this is a 13100 f f is just no Graphics no Graphics that's fine so it's actually better so it should be cheaper yeah you'll save 10 bucks probably I think we went a little overboard on the CPU we went with a 13600 K cuz there was like no we wanted a 5600 x yeah we panicked yeah we panicked there's none and then for motherboard we went with a Asus Prime B6 60 plus which is one of the cheapest LGA 1700 boards that we have in stock we wanted to make sure that our CPU runs at Boost clocks so maybe we can win big in the CPU competition that might push us over the edge yeah man this motherboard looks very cheap Alex exactly and that was one of the original things with going with am4 plat oh my gosh these yeah that's fine very w we went with the ASRock b450 Pro 4 how much do you think these are like I was going to say like 70 maybe 90 that might be pushing like a 100 13100 F and then we got our z690 plus Wi-Fi D4 motherboard it is a much more expensive board than I would have picked but we didn't see any 660 ones left in terms of our estimates we were thinking 13100 130 bucks z690 we said 170 it's probably more I think I'm going to I'm going to adjust estimate to 200 you think so yeah which is a huge bummer for the ram chose the one that was used in the Shen build uh I don't actually know how to pronounce it but it was blurred the last time I pronounced it like this so G ddr4 3200 MHz that's style points right there St that's class if you ask me I think the anime adds five bucks so we're going to go 40 I think that's our estimate all right cross our fingers with that one y this whole build please please please please the only thing we know for sure is that we are over budget all right so we're just going stock cooler here yeah which is nice 0 I actually haven't installed these stock coolers before boy over here okay don't do that this young does not know the ways of the when you boot up a game oh I do my computer still screams what kind of case do we get we got a fantex eclipse G 360a great case this is probably going to come in around $100 yeah maybe one 10 tops we got the fantex eclipse p300 this right here uh it that's quality it feels kind of like junk but not in a way that's like concerning it's not going to hurt me which is like a plus I guess and we have what seems like too nice of a fan in the back I'm a bit concerned about that next is our Flex item oh yeah and Jordan I want you to take a closer look at the box that you chose uh-oh did I do a bad oh sh light strips what hey I know I I 100% would have made the same mistake I was fully reading that as LS 120 assuming 12 mil fans this box looks like a pack of three fans this is not looking good for Jordan while he's handling all the stuff on the motherboard I'm going to be getting the case prepped uh we got this thermal take smart bm3 650 watt 80 plus bronze I think we all had the same strategy we went for thermal take bronze is it just we all consider them cheap I think so I think we were all expecting them to be cheaper than a cic or Corsair one thing that I did not realize when I picked that GPU was that it requires an 800 W power supply so we went with what seemed like the worst 800 wat power supply but not so bad that it would actually just not work what do you think though 65 to 100 it's only 650 watt I think it's 100 tops uh $85 sure it's 650 watt it's bronze yeah thermal take uh they make some great products but they not necessarily the power supply like well that's not ther take that's thermal right oh [ __ ] you're right we love them yeah we do love thermal right the Phantom Spirit 120 SE argb $40 I'm going to say 50 you say 50 cuz yeah it is the Phantom Spirit spirit's newer just going to tighten my cooler down with our LTT Screwdriver from LTT store.com oh yeah yeah don't get screwed be the one who does the screwing one thing that I was thinking mhm uh as far as I can tell there are no bonus points for noise we should go full fan speed on everything I mean we can but like what's the so just so it stays super cool oh yeah it just like might net us a couple FPS I man I'm getting kind of worried that like we're going to be so far off on budget and we're going to like really I got less nervous when I saw Alex grab the 7900 XT I was really hoping that we would have like an XFX or a slightly crappier 7900 XT cuz this right here might be 900 bucks you told you told me 600 it might be so we're banking on 600 bucks that's how much we think it's worth I'm saying 650 okay 650 for our GPU we picked a good old 7700 XT we think it's going to do just fine we didn't want to go overboard on price uh what's 7700 XT 400 500 bucks 500 Buck got be 500 probably 550 Maybe so long yeah like the board is done here the cooler is just massive oh yeah no problem okay that's good Alex Alex oh God I was like hey let's go plug it in like it's like it's like right no I think you can get it I think you can get it oh I okay we're going to need some finagling here we're going to need some finagling we almost had a budget time for a saw wait that means we probably have time to go and Laser we're not laser etching the glass panel Alex yes we are that's we have millimet of clearance I did not think about that at all that GPU is massive so not only did you potentially screw us on price you almost screwed us on actual space okay do you want to plug it in plug it in get it posting yeah how much time do we have 15 15 okay dude we're not going to have time no we're going to have time we haven't even post tested we can post test over there you can do that and worry about the cable management I will make this art literal art all right we're going to the freaking 105 this a stupid idea look I've had only bad ideas today let's not stop okay nothing yet hold on are the board diagnostics saying anything do we have can't read it there's a it's one of those lights that has like four options d so it might be Memory training we'll give it yeah give it a minute all right we're coming over here really really fast we have about 15 minutes I'm going to try in that time to create us a custom side pan now we don't have enough time to do it as like a I don't even remember what it's that called I just need to get going uhoh good we're good light turned off good hey thatb is Alex as pretty as your glass is it'd be really cool if the computer turned on it really would be wouldn't it yeah we still have our dam light d light are these dead David our ddr4 might be bad uh I'm just going to hit start and hope for the best yeah this might guarantee that we totally do not win the style points if it's only half done which is really looking quite likely at the moment Alex I need help getting the computer booted though oh you do I I literally cannot get it to boot uh what yeah so I had it plugged in I know this cable Works cuz it was powering the monitor but I tried unplugging even the front I/O to see if it was the button but I touch the pins and it does not doesn't go the lights are moving something something's happening you stop the at time yeah trouble shoting yeah yeah cuz this I don't think is our fault it seems like it might just actually be a dead power supply what the just happened oh we're [ __ ] we're [ __ ] it got most of the way through too I have no clue why it did that oh you know what happened tinan changed the focal distance of this laser I have I had the laser about as low of a power and as fast as it could get but this is the first time that we have ever etched with this laser this is what I wanted to be on the side panel just the sad Linus on fire team literal Iris I cannot believe that that side panel exploded oh I can I totally can it's almost like we said hey Alex we only have 10 minutes left maybe we shouldn't go for this I'm just going to send it and see what happens I still don't see any LEDs yeah there still is nothing do we have a dead board kind of really looking like it Alex what do you think is more dead the motherboard of the side panel the motherboard we can still put the shards of the side panel in there we could save this but yeah our motherboard's dead so I guess we'll have to figure out what happens next this is really unfortunate yeah okay right okay uh power button 15 seconds Moment of Truth yeah okay we got the RGB that's good that's good on we got lights yellow light Dr Ram oh it's not going away what do you mean it's sticking around we might of a ram issue no as per the rules which you can see here we are going to replace these broken components with working ones and get these computers all tuned up computers are built Windows is installed everything's ready to go it's time for the teams to show off what they have done there's our computer everyone do you like our decoration we got some for free uh and we did pay $10 for this hypn frog so tell us what happened to your side panel Alex decided to tried to laser etch the glass oh my God and he we didn't have the laser dialed in and all of a sudden we heard a shatter so while while you were building a PC he just went to the shop to no no we built the PC and we were so confident it was working we were like let's go laser ET it then it didn't boot cuz the motherboard was dead and then the glass panel shattered all in 5 minutes actually the motherboard wasn't dead we had the ryzen 5600 G from that random Lenovo desktop that is that has a fuse in it that locks it from going in another totally forgot about that we have a whole video on that and you can plug in another ryzen ship into that Lenova board and it will lock that as well I'm pretty sure that's wild it's crazy we have another 5600 G but because we couldn't figure it out we have a different motherboard that David selected for us got it it's equiv value you'll still be uh scored at the original price got it and motherboards aren't super important for performance so we've kind of gone a little bit looser on that and now that he's laid that out this helped us a a lot it turns out that we screwed up and accidentally got a PCI gen 3 board this one is Gen let's go he got it so we have resizable bar enabled we have we have the GPU running at full thing this is really good that would have been a huge St and I see you went with the 7900 XT which is not a mid-range card what uh what was the impetus for that card this was an executive decision by Alex there somebody's m is uny in a $1,000 build I would not recommend this GPU normally but you can get them on sale we're hoping one's on sale right now we estimated this computer costing $1,115 what that's again hoping the GPU is on sale the actual price not bad not bad okay it's not bad $1,249 27 the GPU was $700 and your original motherboard trait really saved you was 100 bucks we're going to have a 24.9% penalty Team B me had trouble from the beginning uh we ended up making a rush decision in getting a 13100 F I was looking for like a 12400 or a 13400 something a lot more balanced but still really low price tough gaming motherboard eh okay yeah yeah so the next problem we were you know locked into our ecosystem based on our CPU choice and I was looking for a b660 board and I couldn't find them in 45 seconds we took one so we ended up with a z690 board oh our total system guess is 1205 okay what's the price what's the price so we were pretty spoton on our guest our big factor was a $270 fcking motherboard oh my goodness W 27 so that gen last gen motherb that's basically our entire overage compared to that one $170 difference on a GD mother you got a nice case though how much was the case it was $70 what godamn it's a pretty computer though I like it tell them what we picked Adam oh team DDR 420 we picked a 13600 K which was um a panic decision uh we had 5 seconds and we grabbed a 13600 K which is probably going to be the thing that hurts us the most in terms of budget absolutely it's a great CPU except for maybe the um uh voltage issues this only has to run for 2 hours so who cares um which also explains our power supply selection we chose a thermal literally the exact same thermal take smart line as everyone else who cares it only needs to be on for 2 hours another downside to our CPU pick was that we had to get a cooler unlike the other two teams who had included coolers with their CPUs I will say as a note to that the cooler that they used is not the included one for the 5600 G we're not going to dock points because it's RGB and it's way cooler but it would come with just the stealth with this which is a black one but will it cool down our price let's see you had the highest yes we were very cynical even with the lowest GPU we guessed at least $350 for our CPU and we came in wow wow nice $1,092 wow turns out we have no idea how much stuff costs but um we always air on the side of of expensive so that's good we kind of know what it costs we were trying to build $1,000 PC we came out around $1,100 I think that's pretty they got a little bit lucky the 13600 K just happens to be on sale good job you guys so that's good you guys are the closest to the Thousand for sure that's going to be a big help ooh okay there's no way that plof would not use an aftermarket cooler that's ploofs oh he's right he knows his stuff I'm a little bit scared at how well L knows us we were so spot on we took a break for the weekend and I've run some of the benchmarks beforehand but we're going to run our last one on camera so get to your freaking stations 3 two one go I started first I win the best part about not having a side panel I can add extra cooling it only helps if it's over why showing them as winning cuz we have a better system duh they're not they drop like crazy yeah we're good oh yeah okay GG easy wow killed them yeah I'm so surprised that 77 to 79 is way bigger of a difference in this game than I expected yeah they're looking like 40% how do they have the fastest CPU score that's a very good question there's like wonkiness with some of the results like they have this massive drop in fps in the middle of the Benchmark this is why like when Labs is doing testing we run things multiple times to make sure that any weird outliers are dealt with whereas this is just have fun with friends run some benchmarks see who does better but oh well we've run the benchmarks and I am shocked at the results in third place is team three with 535 out of 700 in second place is team two with 582 out of 700 and in first place is team one with 639 out of 700 that's a really high catch we'll get they only have 60 points on the table however with a penalty that cost them 24.9% of their performance their final score puts them in second place and the winner is no way let's go wow we haven't talked about the pineapple for good taste what oh you obviously not that it's you guys four out of the six votes yeah that means that they took a very clean Victory not only did they win after price performance adjustment but they got the best looking system hang on hang on hang on we got to deduct a point there a scratch in the glass whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa they also were the closest to an actual $1,000 Mark true which was really awesome tell me how it feels to win well David it feels great you know we played a good game we played a hard game the other guys are out there you know they're giving their all every single night and like we're out there you know and sometimes you take got to take the win do the good with the bad got to just you know give it 110% yeah just like I'm going to give you 110% for the segue to our sponsor ug green their Uno magnetic power bank has attitude but in a cute way it shows you the charging status with adorable emojis like a little sidekick keeping you powered up on the go it packs a beefy 36w hour battery and 15 W wireless charging allowing it to juice up an iPhone 16 Pro one and a half times according to ug Green's testing plus it even has a built-in stand so it doubles as a charger for your desk cool right or if you're on the go you can just slip it into your pocket and it's not just about the power bank ug Green's Uno series also includes Chargers cables and more giving you a bunch of fun and fast charging options check out the ug green Uno magnetic powerbank using the link in the video description if you like competition videos like this please give this a thumbs up you want to do more like this this is super fun uh and if you want to what's a video that would be good to call out cardboard PC oh yeah oh no don't call that out don't call that out awful what everyone loves cardboard PC I didn't go see cardboard PC"

dating game in real life. Starting with the bachelor. This is the bachelor, where girls will be competing
for a chance at love. But before we meet our bachelor,
let's meet our girls. Thank you,
girls, for coming here for a
chance to find true love. Meet your bachelor. Oh, my God. He's so cute. I know, right? It's lovely to meet all of you ladies. I'm Isaac, and I'll be your bachelor. I like your tie. Isaac has planned something to say, so make sure to listen. It's an honor to meet
all of you cool cats. I hope I fall in love with one of you. I know this game is fast and furious. But I'm in the prime of my life
and looking for my future wife. Shall we have a toast? Everyone,
please keep an eye on your glass. I'm quite the germaphobe. Okay, everyone. Cheers to finding true love. Cheers. Now I'll let you guys go and mingle. Me first, Zamfam. There are so many girls
and they seem nice. But when they start
doing those challenges, the claws are gonna come out. You look really nice in that suit. Thank you. I don't usually dress this way. I'm more of a sweatpants
and t shirt kind of guy. And what was your name? He's sick. Could I talk to you for a moment? If it's something you'd like to hear,
sure. I'll be back. I just wanted to say I love sweatpants. When you were talking about
wearing a t shirt and sweatpants, I was like,
let's just get in our pajamas. I was totally trying to talk to him. Don't worry. She won't last. Oh, boohoo. You have to fight hard to win. Why didn't you fight for him? I don't know. I got nervous. Don't worry. I heard that girl in the
purple's definitely in pick me. I thought we weren't
allowed to have phones. What? It was just a quick selfie. The girl in the black is definitely
here for the wrong reasons. I should go steal him. I'll do it. Hey, do you mind if I steal you? Yeah. So how many kids do you want?.. I think it just depends on who I'm with. Everybody makes a different mom, right? I think if I had to have kids,
I'd have at least two. One of each. Yeah. It seems like you're really
prepared for this moment. Look at them. Awesome. I fell in love with him because he,
like, looked at me and I complimented his time. All right. I'm glad you guys have
gotten to know our bachelor. It is now time for our
first rose ceremony. I didn't even get time with him. Ladies,
there are eleven of you, but unfortunately,
Isaac only has six roses. It is now time for him to
decide who gets the rose. Monique. would you accept this rose? Yes. Right over here. Danny, would you accept this rose? Yes. would you accept this rose? As long as we can get married. Not yet. Uh huh... Celeste. would you accept this rose? No. You'd like to? Bella. Sorry. Sorry. Would you accept this rose? I would. All right,
ladies, there's unfortunately only one rose left. I know this is gonna be a
tough decision for Isaac, but it's gotta be done. My gobi makes me. The person I'm giving the final roast to is Molly. Yeah. I knew it. Okay,
the rest of you, please say your goodbyes. I wish we had more time
since I love each other. My mother would have loved you. I guess, um, you weren't really in love. And I guess my compliment about
your tie didn't really work. I'm gonna miss you. Okay. Thank you. Doors that way. Why do I feel relieved? Maybe you just use a restroom. Hopefully she washed her hands. I bet you look horrible in sweatpants. I was really looking forward
to getting to know you, but do you mind if we get a quick selfie? That was tough. It was. All right,
ladies, get ready, because this next challenge is
gonna be at the swimming bowl. For this group date, we're gonna see how well
you know our bachelor. Earlier today, I told you to listen
to what he had to say, and we're gonna see who did. Question number one. What is Isaac's favorite color? Blue. Blue. Red. It is blue. Which means you need to step
forward to the first red line. Question number two. What is Isaac's favorite movie? The notebook. Fast and the Furious. Fast and the furious. The correct answer is
fast and the Furious. Haley, step forward. What is Isaac's favorite drink? Coke. Prime. Gatorade. The correct answer is prime. Both of you must step forward. Girl's getting very close. If you fall in, you are eliminated. What is Isaac's favorite season?.. Spring. Fall. Fall. The correct answer is... fall. Hailey, please step forward. I'm sorry, Hailey, but you are eliminated. Fall really is my favorite. It would have made great babies. Next three girls, get on the plane. Wait. I didn't listen to anything. That speech. I was just looking at his beautiful hair. Remember,
if you fall in the pool, you will be eliminated. Hey, you deserve to be here. I can help you. Really? Yeah. Did you not see me? I won the last round. Thanks. I really like him. What is Isaac's biggest fear? Germs. Airplanes. Spiders. It is germs. Danny, you got it right. The other two, please step forward. What is Isaac's ideal outfit? Sweat pants and t shirt. Suit. Jeans. It is sweatpants. You two got it wrong. Please step forward. What is Isaac's favorite animal? Dog. Cat. Cat. The answer is cat. Danny, you got it wrong. Please step forward. What shape was on Isaac's glass? Star. Star. A heart. It was a heart. Monique and Danny, please step forward. Oh, man. Okay, it's. I'm sorry, Monique, but you are eliminated. At least the water's warm
if you're a single Kaika, you all did well in the pool challenge,
but now it's about finding true love. Isaac,
you have four incredible girls here, but only three roses. It's up to you to decide which
girls will move on and get a rose. Danny, would you accept this rose? Of course. Oh, sorry. I think it's ripped. That's okay. I'm clumsy, too. Would you accept this rose? Yes. Okay. All right,
Isaac, this is your last and final rose. This is gonna be a really
difficult decision, but I'm gonna give this rose to I promise you won't be disappointed. And now you can say your goodbyes. Who do you think you are? The bachelor. Okay, you will now be going on individual
dates with Isaac to get to know him better while cooking, doing art,
and going on a picnic. And before we check on
their one on one dates, we are gonna be playing
another dating game. This is Tinder. In real life,
we play until we get four matches. Let's meet our contestants. For this game, you'll be deciding if the other
person is a good match solely based on first impressions. So if you think they're a good match,
swipe yes. If you don't,
swipe no and head to the back of the line. Is everybody ready? All right, first two, step up. Three, two, one. No. Briana looks nothing
like my ex girlfriend. I said no to Drew. Cause he looks like he
still lives with his mom. Next. 2321. Yeah. too short. Looks like we have one yes and one no. You head to the back of the line. You stay. Step forward. Three, two, one. No. Too young. I didn't even look at her. So far,
we have no matches, but we need to get four. So the next two, step on up. Three, two, one. Yes. Are you serious? She looks like the girl with
assistant in front of class. Three, two, one. Yo. I want someone else to know how it feels. Three, two, one. No. Three, two, one. No. No, she looked way too happy. I did not like his shoes. Three, two, one. No. Three, two, one. Absolutely, yes. Too preppy. Okay, Liz, go ahead and step forward. Three, two, one. Absolutely yes. Three, two, one. Yes. What a beautiful day, right? Just step on over there. Yeah. It's not like he swiped red
on every other girl too. It's a beautiful day for love, Courtney. He got my name right. Three, two, one. the vertical stripes do
not make him look taller. Hopefully,
we find a match in three, two,
one. No, I don't like guys with Hatsheen. He definitely has a bald spot. Three, two, one. No, he looks like my dad. Three, two, one. No, he had a hawaiian shirt on. Three, two, one. Yeah. Okay. I picked her because she looks
a lot like my ex girlfriend. Is that a compliment? And just like that,
we have match number 2321. Yes. Yes. Because she has wonderful hair
and beautiful eyes and teeth. Just so gorgeous. I swipe. Yes. Cause I got confused. Three, two, one. No, I'm not really in a race. Redheads. I think he was kind of a player. Three, two, one. Yes. Three, two, one. Yes. No, I said no to everyone because
they looked way too happy. Okay, Monique, I'm feeling good. Three, two, one. Yes. Wait. What? Can I take a second? I was really nervous. Three, two, one. No. I love the guy in sunglasses. Three, two, one. No, too short. No, me too. Okay. Three, two, one. Yeah. Okay. I picked her because she's really pretty, and I have all of our
kids names picked out. Can I switch? And just like that, we found our four couples who
get to go on a date in real life. Now let's see how our bachelor's
date is going with Bella. So for our date,
we're gonna be making a burger, but I thought it would be more
fun if we played a or that game. So we're gonna take one of each item,
and we're gonna slide it. And whatever one makes
it inside of the square, we have to use ketchup and mustard. Ladies first. Oh, hope we get some sauce on our burger. We got both sauces. Boom. Red and white onion. Which one do you want? I kind of hope we get neither of
them because I'm allergic to onions. Oh, you're allergic? Well, then let's not use either of them. That's no fun. Moving on. After you. Oh, so close. Okay, 1230. So we don't have any
barbecue sauce or mayo, I guess. Moving on to veggie patty or beef patty. I think I'm going frisbee on this one. Hey, you got it. Veggie burger it is. And last but not least,
tomato and lettuce. I'm gonna do bowling. Ready? Bowl away. Are we gonna have double the veggies? Let's see. No, we're not. Let's cook it up. So do you know much about cooking? Not really. I love cooking. Yeah. Let's let these sit for a little bit. Okay. So. Yeah. Can't place it. Where's your accent from? London. London? Yeah. Okay. Have you been? I've never been. Visiting hometowns is pretty serious. Speaking of serious, have you been in any
serious relationships? I was in one recently, but it was a really bad breakup
because he was actually dating our leg up at the same time as well. I would never do that. I won't be lucky to be with you. Well, let's have dinner. These look great. Well,
you were part of cooking them up, so. Thank you. I'm glad I helped by standing now. One for thee and one for me. Thank you. Hopefully these are good. What do you think? What is that too much paprika? Oh, my God. Yeah. I shouldn't have done it. Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? You're so red. Do we need to take you to the hospital? No, no, it's fine. My face just. Okay, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Oh, my gosh. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. I like it when you take care of me. Well, I like taking care of you. Is this better? Yeah. I'm glad. This is parental control. And for this dating game,
I'm gonna be helping Sawyer find love. I'm gonna be bringing in the two
people that normally hate all the boys. She dates her parents. Sawyer is great at gymnastics in school, but she is terrible at
picking her dates dad. So for this dating game, her parents will be picking
the guy she ends up dating. This is gonna be the worst day ever. All right,
you guys enjoy interviewing the boys. The first guy your parents are
gonna be interviewing is Blake. Hey, Blake. Oh, my gosh. This is gonna be so cringy. So, what do you like to do for fun? I like gaming. Gaming? Do your parents like video games? No. Okay, so what kind of grades do you get? I get bees. He gets bees. That's not that bad. Oh, my dad definitely knows he's lying. Maybe a few c's. Where do you play your games? My room. Is your room clean? Messy? How often do you do your laundry? My mom does it. How often do you make your bed? Every time I come home from school,
it's made. So every day... my mom makes me make my bed. Hey. Okay,
so now they are interviewing Atticus. So why should we let
you date our daughter? I think your daughter's,
like, really cool and I would love to date her. What do your parents do for work? It's better if I don't tell you. How many girls have you dated? Uh, two or three. Two or three? You don't know? He seems really sweet and nice. But why doesn't he know how
many girlfriends he's had? Two. What's your GPA? 3.5. A's and B's. What do you like to do for fun? I play a little soccer in my free time. What do you think of Atticus? He seems nice,
but I don't know if he's my type. What's your type? That's the problem. Okay, so this last guy is Derek. Ooh, he seems cool. He's slouching. That's cool. You look like a little
bit of a troublemaker. When's the last time you got grounded? Last week. For what? Borrowed my dad's car. How old are you? 13. You don't even have a permit. I don't need a permit. He's only 13 and he can drive already. He cannot legally drive. Okay, so if you take our daughter out on a date,
where are you gonna take her? I'd drive. We'd go to a movie. How are you gonna pay for that? I know a guy. He's gonna sneak you into
a movie without paying. That's resourceful. I call that something else. Okay, Sawyer here is your first date. Blake. Hi. Nice to meet you. Okay,
so for your date, you're gonna be doing a viral TikTok
trend where you're gonna rock, paper,
scissors. If you win, you get to eat your food. If you lose, you gotta go there and back. We play until someone eats three times. Okay, time starts now. Rock pickles is a shoot. Oh, he's winning. He got some food. Oh. you gotta go fast. Okay. Oh, swear gets more food. Wow. Sawyer dominated that. All right, you guys, that is time. Consumer. You won three times. And you know what? Why don't you guys just get
to know each other better? So I heard you play video games. I play Madden. Oh, nice. I play just to impress. Oh, I played that a few times. Oh, nice. What do you do on your weekends? Usually just sleep in game. How late do you sleep? Until noon. Gets up at noon. Sawyer's up at six. I have to wake up early
for gymnastics practice. I don't ever wake up early. What a spoiled little brat. Zamfam. I have no idea what her
parents are thinking of Blake, but comment below if you think your
parents would let you date him. Do you do anything outdoors? Hiking? I'm an indoor person. So play video games. They seem to be getting along,
but they're also complete opposites. So are you close with your family? Yeah, of course. Me too. My mom does everything for me. His mom does everything for him. Blake is definitely a mama's boy. My mom makes me do everything. Yeah, that sucks. Okay, that is the end of date number one. Sawyer, let's take you to date number two. Well, he's a good looking kid. Nice enough. You're not picking him? Well, I don't know. I'm not picking him. I'm not sure. Sawyer, what do you think your parents
thought of date number one? Blake? I don't think they really like him, but I think he was really sweet. Okay,
well, you haven't seen the other guys yet, but now you are on to date
number two with Atticus. Come on in. Okay, so you guys can get to know
each other a little better, I thought we would play a game. I am gonna roll the garbage can across,
and if you get the shots, then you get to ask the
other person a question. Are you guys good at basketball? No. No. You have one thing in common. Great. Okay, are you guys ready?.. 3210. Since you both made it,
you each get to ask each other a question. How many girlfriends have you had? Uh, like four. Didn't he tell us? Two to three girls. How many boyfriends have you had? Only one, but my parents hated him. Three, two, one. Sawyer gets asked Atticus a question. What is the most embarrassing
thing you've ever done? I wore the same pair of
socks for a month straight. That is way too long. That is disgusting. Gross. That's disgusting. Okay, but it was my lucky soccer socks. 3210. You both get to ask each other a question. So, have you ever lied to a girlfriend? Of course not. What's your type when
it comes to dating boys? I'm usually into bad boys,
but my parents are. All right,
that concludes the end of date number two. I hope you had a good time with Atticus. Now,
Sawyer, you're going to date number two. Three, come on over. I mean,
he has great hair, but he's dated quite a few girls. Come on in. He's already taking money out of the jar. Swear. This is date number three. Derek. Hi. We will be playing for this date. Eat it or spill it. What you'll do is you'll throw this up. If it lands on eat,
you have to eat one of these. Healthy, delicious. If it says skip, you don't have to eat it. Yes. Yeah, but you have to answer a question that your parents sent me to ask. So good luck. Ladies first. It's really okay. Eat it. Okay, Sawyer, your turn. It says skip. Let's see. Is Derek your type? I guess. Or she would navigate. I'm just gonna pick him. Skip. Okay, I have a list of questions for you. Have you made a girl cry? Maybe once or twice. Why? You don't wanna know. Who is this kid? Eat up. Oh, Brussels sprout. Oh, man. Would you ever go against
what your parents say? Of course. Of course. You know, they're watching this right now. I mean, of course nothing. Okay, Derek. have you ever cheated on a test? Does it still count as
cheating if I got 100? Yes. Well, maybe. Go ahead. Sawyer. Have you ever snuck out
of your house at night? No, but I would. I'm bolting the doors. I don't know what's going on here. Derek. Go ahead Oh, eat that, kidde Have you ever snuck out of your house at night? Every day. He's probably sneaking
out to make girls cry. Every day. What are you doing? I know a guy. Who's this guy? He keeps talking about? Okay. Well, that concludes date number three. And now it's time to see if you
and your parents agree on the guy that you should date. We gotta think about this. Yeah, we do. In order for Sawyer to go on
another date with one of the guys, both the parents and her,
I have to agree on the guy. So we're sure? We're sure. We got it. We got it. Okay. Sawyer, do you think you know which
guy you are going to choose? I think so. Okay. Well,
let's hope your parents and you match and agree on the same guy. Hey, um, can I talk to Sawyer real quick? Like, alone? Sure. Hey, Sawyer. I really need to come
clean about something. Okay. The truth is,
I actually haven't had four girlfriends. Had zero... I'm really sorry I lied. I just was really scared that I would have
shown up and you would have had a bunch of boyfriends, and I would have had zero. It's okay... I didn't actually have a boyfriend. It was only a crush. Well, I'm really sorry I lied to you. And I really hope you pick
me for the next round. Okay. Okay, Sawyer, this is it. It is time to write down which guy you think you should date. Parents,
it's time to reveal which guy you chose. So we chose Atticus. Atticus,
if what you wrote matches your parents. You get to go on a date. It's time to reveal which guy you chose. I chose Atticus. Thank God. Which means you two have been eliminated. Well, it looks like your parents have
better taste than you thought, and this dating game might be over. But your date just started,
and you better have her back by 08:00 p.m. yes, sir. This dating game is next,
and we have a bus full of guys. Yes, they'll be competing to
go on a date with Lindsey. I'm Lindsey, and I'm a yoga instructor. But when it comes to guys,
I'm a little less flexible. For every minute they last on the date,
they'll earn $1, and at the end, they'll get to decide if they
want to go on a second date with Lindsey or take the money. Okay, Lindsay, let's meet your first guy. Looks like I'm up first, so you guys will be
staying in the bus forever. No way. Hi, I'm Lindsey. Hi. My nickname is Bean. Hi, Bean. Oh. Are you ready to go on our first date? Yeah, let's do it. Hopefully, he doesn't get nexted. If Lindsey doesn't like
how the date is going, she's allowed to say next. And another guy from the
bus will take his spot. So let's see if they're a match or if
she tells this guy to banana split. Lindsey wants a guy? That's sweet. So you guys will be making ice
cream sundaes for your date. Enjoy. Yum. I'm so glad I got chocolate. It's my favorite. I'm an old timey guy,
so I love a tuxedo, which is perfect. Cause that's actually my
favorite coffee drink. This guy's boring. Like, this bus. They seem to be getting along great. Those other three might
not be getting off the bus. Then let's actually eat these some days. Okay, let's go. So, what kind of music do you like? I like all types of music. Look, I cannot stand country. I mean,
banjos, they only sing songs
about babies and trucks. It's, like, barely even music. And Taylor Swift. Are you kidding me? Ugh. He's not a swifty. You know what? I've been to stagecoach every single year,
and I'm a huge swifty, so. Next. Oh, next. Next. That was an easy no. If you're not a swiftie,
you're not for me. Oh, my gosh. Well, looks like it's time for
the doctor to take over. Okay,
Lindsey, you've nexted your first guy. Let's see. Guy number two. The doctor is in. Paging doctor romance. Next. Oh. he didn't even have to say anything. I just knew it was a next. What happened, man? Time for her to meet a real Casanova. So just get cozy. For your next date, you guys are gonna be playing our
newborn game at Walmart called Detention Escape. Are you excited? So excited. Let's bring in the next guy. Oh, yeah. My shirt is definitely coming off. Hola. Hola. Hi. My friends call me senor suave,
but you can just call me suave. But what is this? So, this is Rebecca's new game. You can actually get it from Walmart. You know,
actually, instead of this game,
I kind of want to get to know you better. So let's ask each other questions,
and if we get it wrong, we have to remove a layer of clothing. Let's do it. Do you think I've kissed more than
three boys or less than three boys? Definitely more. Wrong. Okay, you're going. Shoes. That's smart. He's already removing his shoes. Do you think I've been with more
than or less than ten girls? Less than ten. More than ten girls? He's been with over ten girls. It wasn't, you know, anything serious. You know, do you think I'm more of a
Sabrina Carpenter fan or more of an Olivia Rodrigo fan? Oh,
you seem like a bad girl, so I definitely say
Sabrina Carpenter wrong. That was my second guess. I guess my shirt is coming off. No, no, you don't need a to do that. You seem kind of like a player to me, and I'm just looking for
something more serious right now. So. Next. She's nexting him. Aw,
she didn't want to see with your shirt. It's all right, boys. Thanks for warming her up for me, guys. I'll take it from here. You've nexted another guy, so I think it's time for
you to get a checkup. Oh, yeah. I'm about to score the winning touchdown. How's it going? Hi, I'm Lindsey. I'm Jace. Okay,
well, Lindsay loves a fit and healthy guy,
so we brought in a doctor,
and you're gonna get a checkup. Tell me about yourself. What do you like to do for fun? Basketball,
volleyball, football,
of course. And track. What about you? Any sports or. I'm a yoga instructor. They seem to really like each other. I don't think she's gonna next him. So, have you ever been in
a serious relationship? I've been in one relationship. It was a good one, but she moved away. Oh. So it's been six months. Don't talk about the ex. Is he done? No, no, no. We gotta make sure you're physically fit. What do you look for in a girl? I definitely love somebody. That's funny. The date is going really strong,
and she has not said next yet. He could be the one that wins this. Gotta touch your toes. Oh, this one's hard, doc. Let's see. This is important. This is important. She's right. I just played a game yesterday. No, he's probably sore. He probably needs to stretch. Time's up. All right. come on forward. It's your turn to decide if
you want to go on a second date with him. Yes, I do. Okay,
Jay, you have the chance to go
on a second date with her. Or you can take the $10 that you earned
for every minute you were on a date. Which one are you gonna choose? You're an amazing person. You're into sports. Literally everything that I would look for a girl. So I could definitely see
us going on another date. But I need the money. I think I'm gonna just take $10. This is ten, right? Yeah. It's only ten. This is food. Fair play to him. Poor Lindsey. That completes next. And until then,
Lindsey's still gonna be looking for love. Let's do a quick check in and see how
our bachelor state is going with Danny. So you seem like a super fun girl,
and I figured we should do something fun, like make art together. Yes. I love art. Let's do it. Figure out if you have the
same touch as Bob Ross. What are you making? You. Me? You know,
this is fun, but,
you know, it's more fun. What? So, what do you like to do for fun? Actually, I do gymnastics. Wanna see something? Uh, yeah. What? That's insane. I don't know that I could
do anything even closer. I bet you could actually go. Okay, now, Siri, serious question. Have you ever been in
a serious relationship? Serious like this? Not quite. Welcome to the dating game. This is Anthony. And Anthony is looking for a
date to take to his school dance. What are you looking for in a girl? I love to laugh, so I want a date that is
not afraid to be silly. Ha ha ha. You seem nervous. Let's bring out our contestants. Now. Let's meet our contestants and
see why Anthony should pick them. Contestant number one, I think you should pick me because I
turned down a lot of dates to be here. Wow. Anthony, what do you think about that? I guess I'm a lucky guy then. Contestant number two, I think you should pick me
because I look like a princess. And you could be my prince. Well,
hopefully you're my happily ever after. We'll see. Contestant number three. I think you should. Did she pick me? Cause I like to dance. So do I. Well,
you are going to a dance, so that works. Now that you've met the contestants,
it's time for you to ask some questions. How many boyfriends have you had? I never went without a boyfriend,
and I want you to be my next. I've only ever had one
serious relationship. I like a girl who's committed. I've never had a boyfriend. We'll move on to the next question. Have you ever cheated? Ooh, now things are gonna get spicy. I wouldn't on you. Thank you. Wait, was that a yes or a no? Contestant number two. Of course I wouldn't cheat. I'm very loyal. I cheated on my toothpaste once. Instead of crest. I tried Colgate. Well, it sounds like you have great teeth. And that concludes the questions
as we move on to part two. For this next round, each of the girls will be
given a honeydew to kiss, and Anthony will be rating them. All right,
ladies, go ahead and kiss your melon... Those sounds ASMR. How you feeling right now, Anthony? I'm a little nervous. I'll be back with the honeydews. All right, here you go. This is contestant number one. What do you think? There's a lot on here. I have a lot of experience. Well, I like a girl. Confidence. Here is contestant number two's kiss. Oh, this one looks good. There's only one, but it's perfect. It is kind of perfect. It matches perfectly. Okay, that's just getting weird. Contestant number three. Oh, there's a bite in this one. Yeah. I've never had my first kiss,
but you said I had nice teeth, so I thought I'd leave a mark. Well, I can definitely see your
teeth marks in this one. Okay, let's toss that. And that is the end of round one. For round two, we're gonna get creative. I love to draw,
so I want to see if you ladies can too. You have three minutes to
paint your own self portrait. Time starts now. What's your experience in painting? I've never done this before,
but I did used to finger paint. I don't know if that counts. Ooh,
I see you working on yours, Chris,
what's your experience with painting? Well, I get. As in every class. I'm not actually surprised. I see you're a little off
center with the portrait. All that matters is that he picks me. Touche. It's not about who's the best artist, but which piece of art
Anthony connects to most. Your time's up. All right,
Anthony, it's time to see the art
that these girls made. Here is contestant number one. Self portrait... Oh, it looks like she's trying
to make herself a bee. Oh, like a bumblebee. Yeah. Well,
at least she knows what she wants to. I know what I want, and I'm gonna get it. Contestant number two. It's perfect, but it doesn't have a body. Hey,
perfection takes time, and I felt rushed. But you have a body, though, right? And contestant number three. Wow, I really noticed the hair. Yep. The shoes. Red shoes. Yep. But mostly the teeth. Yes. Thanks. Yep, those are definitely some teeth. Now that they have all
drawn their self portrait, which one do you like the most? I'm gonna have to go
with this one right here. Contested number two. She won this round, but will she be the winner
going to the dance with him? We'll find out,
but now we move on to round three. This is the balloon pop
spill the tea challenge. Anthony wants to see how well
you girls do under pressure. You're gonna have to pop a balloon
and answer whatever's inside. Contestant number one. Oh, what is your favorite holiday? My favorite holiday's new year's,
because I get that New Year's kick. Or kisses. Mine is Halloween. Contestant number two. Oh,
we didn't pop a balloon, so we don't have any questions to ask. Well,
it doesn't really matter, because I don't have any secrets. Figured she'd say that. Contestant number three. Oh, what is your favorite roblox game? Stress to impress. It's mine too. Okay,
so which answer do you like best, my fellow roblox player. All right,
well, it's not over,
because we have one last and final round. Let's see how the girls do. For this final round, you will have to pick out a gift
that you think best describes you to present to Anthony. You have 32nd time starts. Now. Anthony,
as of right now, do you know which girl you
are gonna bring to your dance? One girl started off strong, but I think there's another
girl who might be better. Well, we are about to find out. Now that you girls have your gifts,
it's time to present them. Contest number one. Thank you. Hey, Anthony, you kiss this too? I thought you would like it. And what is it, Anthony? It's a basketball. I don't really play sports. Oh, come on. What kind of guy doesn't like sports? Contestant number two... Thank you. Here you go. Let's see. What. Oh, my God. Why would you give me a spider? I thought you liked Halloween. I like Halloween, but not spiders. Can you get that away? That's not even right. Contestant number three. It's nothing alive, is it? No. Okay. I hope not. Here you go. Thank you. It's marbles, just like in squid game. Well, yeah, yeah, marbles are cool. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay,
Anthony, we have done four challenges, but now it is time for you to pick
one to take to your school dance. Do you know who you're gonna pick? Number one, you seem like you have
a lot of experience, but a little too much experience for me. You're eliminated. Contestant number one, please. Oh. Oh. I can't believe I turned
out seven dates for you. You're missing out, bro. Up that way. Okay, she's a little bit scared. I agree. Okay, Anthony, it is down to two girls. Contestant number two and
contestant number three, who are you gonna choose? Well,
contestant number three, you did take bite marks and the melon,
and it kind of scared me a little bit. Contestant number two,
you're perfect, but too perfect for me. I'm sorry. You're eliminated. Contestant number two,
come reveal yourself. That's okay. You missed out, though. Okay. Right that way. These some contestants pay
attention to directions. Okay, Anthony, this is it. This is going to be your
date to your school dance. Are you ready to meet her? Yes, I am. Contestant number three,
please reveal yourself. Hi, Anthony. Hi. Will you go to the dancing room? Maybe you should ask her name. Um, what's her name? Brooke. Hi, Brooke. And there we have it, folks. Another successful dating game where
we find love with singled out, where one girl will choose
from all these guys. but she's gonna have to choose one without ever seeing them. Now let's meet our girl Mikayla. Come on out. Okay,
Mikayla, you can take off your blindfold. How excited are you? Oh, my gosh. I'm so ready. Boys. How excited are you? All right, well, let's find you a date. Whoever I pick,
I'm gonna have a first kiss with, and I'm so nervous. We have different categories on this wall. You are gonna pick one, and if your answer is
different from the guys, they will be eliminated. However, you may use this golden ticket on
one of those contestants to see. Which category would you like first? Let's do social first. YouTube or TikTok? TikTok is great for scrolling,
but I would pick YouTube, which means all the guys that pick TikTok,
you're eliminated. You're missing out. On these dancers. TikTok is way better. Come on now. We could have had something. Golden ticket. I'm waiting for someone special. Oh,
we've lost some guys, but,
Mikayla, there are plenty more. Pick your next category. Fashion boxers or briefs? I need someone to match
my active lifestyle, and you can't do that in boxers. So brief. All right,
anyone who picked boxers, you gotta leave. I guess you're never gonna know
what it's like to be on Cocoa beach. Please, I just need some more sleep. Tonight I'll spend my $5 gift
card to McDonald's with you. Let's limit the begging for the ticket. She'll know when it's right. Mikayla,
go ahead and pick your next category. Let's do dates. Mikayla, would you rather sit and watch a
movie or play a round of mini golf? Definitely mini golf. Any of the guys that pick
sit and watch a movie, you gotta go. I don't even like you anyway. Oh, be nice. Okay,
I know this sounds cliche, but,
like, may I? Sorry. See, on the date? No arguing... Hold on. Oh,
I might want to give you this, but I think I need to
see a little bit more. Oh. I would definitely want
a first kiss with him. How bad do you want that golden ticket? I work for the golden ticket. Thank you. It looks like you are moving on to the
next round with the remaining gold. Now that we've narrowed
it down to our final six, it's time to get to know them better. What's up? I'm Joe, and I just started a podcast
all about being a dude. Okay, next up. Hey,
I'm Theo, and I just built my own mansion. Oh, wow, that's impressive in Minecraft. Oh, not as impressive. It's really cool. It's made out of bedrock,
and it has two beds, and it protects me from the zombies. And it's in Minecraft. Next up. Hey, what's up? My name's Drew hamster,
and I made this dance move just for you. Okay. I can't see it. Yeah, yeah, she can't see. He didn't quite understand the assignment. What's up? My name is Jayvian. I have once had over ten dogs. Aw. I love animals, but they all run away. Oh, do you have a dog now? I do not have a dog now,
but we can get one. Though I wouldn't recommend that. My name is Cameron,
and I am an exclusive beach EMT. Ooo. Like Ken. Like Ken. My job is beach, but I save lives. Oh. Well, I need a man who can save me. As long as it's at the beach. Yes, we know. And finally, how's it going? My name is Javier, and I know how to run. Roll my arse. Ooh. Javier. Javier, indeed. Now that we've gotten to
know all our contestants, I'll let Mikayla explain why
we're doing this next challenge. Well,
I love slushies, and I need someone who
can drink them with me. So whichever guy finishes their
slushie first automatically moves on to the next round. On your marks, get set. Slushy, dinner. I'm done. I'm done. No, you didn't drink it. It's on the floor. You don't want to see what I saw. Okay, Jayvian, show me your cup. That is,
in fact, empty, which means jv and you are automatically
moving on to the next round. The rest of you guys,
get ready for another challenge. I'm an animal lover. Which is why you guys will have
to make your best animal sound. No, no, no, no. Not together. Individually. And then Mikayla will pick her top two. Let's start with you, Cameron. Monkey. True. Some sort of bird. That was a silver foot
quail from Mashupishi. Well, we know he's a bird lover. Okay, Theo. Oui. Snaw. Is that how it sound? So, horse, there you have it. Meow. Oh, cat. Okay, this is getting weird. What is that? That's a giraffe. Oh, my. That went differently than I thought. You've heard all the animal sounds. Which two guys do you want? Moving on to the final three? I'm gonna pick Cameron and Javier,
which means everyone else, you're eliminated. I also play Fortnite. I'm a prize you missed out on, baby. What? For sure? Dating is so hard. Love me. Okay. no sympathy votes. Here it is. Now down to the final three. And I'll be asking all of you questions,
and if your answer matches Mikayla's, you'll get to step forward. The first person to
her throne wins a date. Okay, the first question. Love or money? Love. Love. The niro. Okay, Michaela, what's your answer? Love. Which means if you answered love,
you get to step forward. Halloween or Christmas. Zamfam, make sure you play along
in the comment section. Halloween for sure. Nabida. Christmas. Christmas. Which means you do get to step forward. Holding hands or hugs. Oh, I'm all for a good hand hold. Yeah, holding hands. I'm kind of afraid of hands,
so I gotta hug. Okay, Mikayla, what is your answer? Holding hands. Oh, it's a three way tie, which means any of them could be going on a date
with Makayla and getting a first kiss. Next. Boys, do you prefer iPhone or Android? I'm on the big Apple. IPhone. Androids, they have way better camera. IPhone has better editing on the camera. IPhone. A green text is a red flag. Everyone can move forward
except the Android. This could be it. There are two guys right now that
only need to answer one more question that matches Michaela's
to win that dated first kiss. Olivia Rodrigo or Sabrina Carpenter. This is causing a lot of
controversy right now. This one's tough. Oh, my God. Olivia, Javier. Sabrina, baby. Sabrina Carpenter. Okay,
so, mikayla,
we have two guys at the end. They both had different answers,
which means one of them is gonna win this. So reveal your answer, please, please, please. Which means,
cameron, go ahead and step forward,
but don't reveal yourself. Mikayla, it's time for you to see the two guys
that won't be going on a date with. With you. I was this close, and I love handholding. Good thing I had two of them,
but sucks you can't hold them. I don't know what that means,
but it sounds flirty. I can't believe I'm about to kiss
a guy I've never seen before. I can't wait. This is gonna be the best date ever. Zamfam. I really hope she likes the guy she chose. And now it's time for Mikayla
to finally meet her date. On the count of three, you two are gonna turn around and
see your date for the first time. 1230. My God. Thank God you're cute. Can I hug you? Of course I can kiss you. Yeah. Are you ready for your date? So ready. Let's go. Time to check in on our bachelor's
dinner date with Celeste. What is this? Just a little something I made us a little bit of spaghetti, people. Ooh, like lady in the tramp. But I thought I would make
it a little more exciting. And instead of using regular utensils, we have to eat it with
whatever is inside our napkin. Let's do it. A plastic square. How are you on this? Let's dig in. We have to share. What are you doing? Isn't that how you use this? No. So you have to open it. Okay. And then grab it open. Yes. Thank you so much. Well,
since you got spaghetti on my face, I think it's only fair that I get some back on yours. Real talk. I'm a ten. Mm hmm. You're a ten. These other girls are not a ten. You don't think any of them are pretty? No. If you're a ten and I'm a ten. Seems like a pretty easy decision. I'll make that decision easier for you... Our next dating game is room raiders. Meet Liz. Liz loves animals,
playing sports and doing yoga. What can I say? I love cuddling and being fit. Liz is gonna choose one of three
guys to go on a date with, but has to decide only
looking at their rooms. I'm so ready. Before we get started,
though, we have to remove the boys. 459. Hey, noob. What are you doing in my room? No, I'm not done with my set. Come on. I'm doing everything. Heck. Heck, get in the van. Um, five more minutes. No. You're getting raided. Huh? What are you doing? You're not my mom. Let's go. Get in the van. What the rob? I get swatter right now. No, you're getting raided. Look. Come on. Get in there. This y'all first time getting raided? What's raided? This is room raters. It is? Look at the screen. Oh, yeah. Okay, Liz, this is room number one. Now,
remember, we removed photos from all of the
guys rooms so you won't be able to see what they look like. You have to judge based on
what they have in their room. Come on in. Oh, he's going in your room. Oh. Get ready to lose, boys. Okay, so what do you think? Well,
it looks like he's really into sports, and I find that health and fitness
is really attractive in a guy, so. I like that. What? Ew. My mom hasn't done my laundry yet. Your mom does your laundry? What is it? Little mermaid. Little mermaid? What? He has a little mermaid. Blankethe in touch with his feminine side,
you know? Okay. Yeah. Oh, he has a cat... Oh, I love that. Do you have a cat? Leave Mister p out of it. Okay,
so, so far,
we know that he's fit, he's really good at sports. Okay. Yeah. And he loves animals,
so, so far,
that meets all my criteria. Okay, you're making all of
this based off his room? Let's check out his closet. Oh, what is that? Quit making fun of me. They're collectibles. Do you know how much they're worth? I think I saw something that I love. Okay, clowns are a red flag for me. I hate clowns. What? I always need to drink water
in the middle of the night. This is genius. You guys can call me an inventor. Let's see what's in the drawer. What is this? A diary. You have a diary? Dear diary,
coach was really hard on me today. It sucked. Bad day. Today will be better. Okay. He's an optimist. So many sports. How do I choose? And they're little drawings of the sport. Oh, my gosh, Zamfam, you lost it, man. She's definitely not gonna choose you. You are picking who you want
to date based on their room. Yeah, I think I've seen everything
I need to for this room. Are you sure? Let's move on to room number two. Okay, Liz, get ready. Cause we're about to see room number two. Oh, what is that smell? It's not my fault. I don't know where the
smell is coming from. I'm seeing a lot of gaming stuff. Are these lucky charms? I wouldn't eat that if I were you. It's stale. They're better when they're stale. Ew. What is ew? What? Dude, that is a bat. It's a dead bat. Speaking of dead animals, there's. I don't know if this is real. It looks like it duffed. Oh, you must stay up late
and drink a lot of Fonta. The gamer always gotta have his faunce. Do you know what sugars in that? I think he spends a little too much time. There's a lipstick. Isn't that like a Roblox character? What if he has a crush on
a video game character? What is that? Do you want me to pick it up? What if I try it? What is that? Are those. Those are teeth right there. He's definitely a vampire. Are you good with this? Yeah, I think I've seen enough. Okay, let's get out of here. Have fun playing solo, player, my man. Cause she's choosing me. Oh, she hasn't seen my room yet. Princess, this is the last and final room. Are you ready? As long as it doesn't have baby teeth,
I'm good. I can't guarantee anything. Hey, here we go. Oh,
it actually smells kind of good in here. Yeah, this is the best smelling room yet. See, boys? Lavender, lavender, lavender. Girls love it. Must be, like, some sort of musician. It looks like I'm singing like a guitar. Correct. He's got an air mattress. No, bed frame. Bed frames are a scam. Think you're just broke. Looks like. Yes. Some sort of pet. I don't really see anything in here. It says rat food. So he has a pet rat. Maybe it's, like, hiding. I don't see it. I don't think it's in there. Oh, no. What? Nothing. Nothing. What is this white plastic? That's a security tag. They do that so clothes don't get stolen. They're not stolen. Wait, it's on a lot of these. Did he steal his clothes? I'm just borrowing them. My favorite book growing up. Chronicles of Narnia. All right. Yeah, that's a good. That's a good choice. Yes. Ooh, white gloves. You know what I have to do with these? The white glove test. Okay, okay. He did not pass the white glove test. There is definitely dirt on that glove. Yo. Okay. Get that away from me. Ah, there he is. Don't let him out. Okay,
Liz, you have seen all three rooms,
but you only get to date one guy. Who is the first room that
you want to eliminate? Room number two. Let's see who's behind room number two. This is Ethan. Hi. Hello. As much as I like vampires,
the baby teeth were a little too much. And for that reason,
I have to eliminate you. Well, that's game over for you. You gonna miss this avatar? Oh. maybe that's a good thing. There are two guys left,
but you only can date one. Which one are you gonna choose? Let's bring out room number one. This is Kyle. Wow, you look even better in person. You do too. Look how fit you look. Thank you. I think this could work out. I like that you're athletic and you're
really in touch with your feminine side. But I did find a page in your diary,
and it had all these girls numbers, and I don't really like players. So for that reason,
I have to eliminate you. Oh, yeah? Well, the only thing I like to
cheat on are my meals. It is time to meet your date, Liz. Room number three, come on out. This is Stephen. Hi. Hi. I like that you're a musician, and we definitely need to work
on your gluttonliness, because your rat almost bit me. But I really like that you're into music,
and I think this could work. So would you want to see a movie? Yeah. I love movies. It looks like they are
going on their first date, and now we are going to see who the
bachelor chose to give the final roast to. Isaac, you have now gone on one on one
dates with all of the girls. How to? I had a phenomenal time
with each one of them. Bella,
I had a great time cooking with you, even though you did have
an allergic reaction. Yeah, I shouldn't have eaten those onions. Celeste,
we had an amazing picnic, and I really felt like there
was a connection between us. I thought so, too. And Danny,
my little artist, you sure do know how to have some fun. I had a really fun time with you, too. It's a tough decision,
but only one person gets the final rose. Are you ready to do it? I'm ready... Danny, please come down. Although I did have a great
time making r with you, I don't think it was for life. It was just a moment. I'm gonna have to let you go. It is down to the final two girls. You've had great connections
with both of them, but only one is your true love. Are you ready to make that final decision? I think I'm ready, Celeste. Police have. Warden. Although you had the most sparkly dress
and an equal sparkle in your eye, I think the spark between us is now extinguished. I'm gonna have to let you go. Pink isn't your color. It's fuchsia. And Rebecca. What? No. No... I was just gonna. Thank you for putting this on for me. Okay. Okay. Isaac, you have your final rose. You've been through a lot,
but there is one final girl here. Are you ready to give away that rose? Bella, please step forth. You know the saying that there are layers and onions. I do. And, uh. I think there are more layers between us
than we could have ever even imagined. And it would be a disservice to
stop exploring those layers now. Would you accept this rose? I would love to accept this rose. Make sure to get in there."

test it out in the Lego room to see if it actually works the first thing I'm going to do is upgrade our Lego desk that we built so we can actually hold the gaming setup we don't need the hidden computer anymore because we're going to have an actual computer on top of this so we need to rebuild this area and then make it a bit stronger so this thing will actually hold it up we may even be able to make it just a little bit bigger now that we've made our desk a bit bigger by a factor of this much I'm going to start laying Technic bricks across the top of this make it two more layers thick and then we'll come in with some more plates and add tiles to it to finish it off we're just going to lock together a bunch of these end to end and hopefully that'll make it look pretty good I just had this really cool idea if we take an LED strip we can take some of these little clear panels and make an RGB desk by just lining the side with it and then we take our LED strip and just put that right behind and hopefully it'll glow I think it's going to make that a lot cooler so I'm going to go with [Music] that oh my gosh that's dope bro check it out guys it responds to sound too it's literally an RGB gaming desk I just had an amazing idea I think it would be really cool to put the PC inside the desk like have a clear spot on top so you can see it and you can still game over it but it'll be inside there and we'll put like some sort of fan for airflow or something underneath now we just got to finish building up the top of this now what I'm doing is just grabbing some plates and tapping this off and then hammering it down the last step in this part of the desk is just covering the top with tiles and for that I'm going to use a bunch of two 2 X2 dark bluish gray check it out there's like lightning coming out of where the PC is going to go I upgraded the drawer to make it fit the vibe a little bit better you can see I recolor the front here which looks cool snap the legs into place here and then we can just put our desktop theoretically right on top of this I'm also going to remove a few of these panels in the wall and tie this in with bricks because that'll keep it from wobbling around all right so step one is complete build an awesome Lego desk next though we need to actually build in the gaming PC itself now to actually run this gaming setup I bought Boom the world's smallest gaming PC complete with three modes of loudness in off on button and like two USB ports no I'm just kidding it's got four this is a Mini PC and supposedly this thing's pretty quiet and pretty powerful is it even on so I'm going to go ahead and build up a little hammock for this using Technic bricks and then we can hang this inside that little area in the desk and by the way there's going to be links in the description for all the stuff I'm using in this video if you guys want to try and build this yourself so we build two of these guys put this on top just got to kind of build up and over so you can see I've just locked these around it and I've left all the slots for like USB and stuff accessible also have these little things jutting out down here and the reason for those is now we can actually take some Technic pieces and hang this under the desk but first since this is going to be visible I'm just going to add a few more details to the top of this and make it look a little bit cooler so I just finished up doing some gribling and as you can see it is very gribly there's just lots of different details and none of it really serves a purpose but the whole point of gribling with Lego is just like small details that no one really thinks about I have these little Technic bricks sticking out with these pins in it and so now what I can do is just take a few of these guys and stick them on like this and now those should theoretically just hook right into here there we go wow that looks so cool oh my gosh and if we use some panel type things like this we can actually build a little clear thing I'll just sit on here let you see through and become a part of the desk surface that you can play on now we put this guy in and it looks so dope I'm thinking we'll take our Lego fan which actually works and put this underneath to give it some air flow and since nothing's going to go under the drawer like legs or anything I think I just put it at an angle and kind of build it into the bottom of this now we got this thing mounted under here and the battery box is simply inside this drawer all we got to do is turn it on and it turns on the fan dude you can totally feel it under here too that should keep our PC cool the next thing our gaming setup needs is a mouse and keyboard so for our computer mouse we have this guy which looks like a mess of wires and circuitry and that's because it is so we can build a Lego casing around it so I'm just going to use some plates and wedge plates to create a sort of mouse shape on the bottom and then we'll build up the sides from there and make it comfortable all right so I've stripped it down to be a little more Bare Bones we got our battery which attaches and then this little RGB LED which is nice cuz it'll make it look like a gaming mouse and we just need to stick this down in there this feels like a good size for a mouse actually I'm just going to build up the walls of this be a little bit higher and they'll add the buttons that'll make it actually click for the scroll wheel what I'm going to do is take a Lego Tire take it off the tire like this and then put it on there so we have a Lego surface in the middle and now we have a Lego scroll wheel and it works now I'm trying to get a button design that will actually click this little blue piece in here I just got to find the right combination of pieces so I can combine it with that but this is not it we got a little sensor visible on the bottom and that should work to make it go around like this and also while I'm building this make sure you guys check out crazy Kai brickling store they have a ton of Lego pieces in stock in all sorts of different colors and shapes I just really like them cuz they ship fast and they're super nice over there so make sure you click the link down in the description if you want to increase your Lego CLI C all right here we have our finished computer mouse and this thing actually works for the button mechanism all I did was just use this technique they use on Lego trains to turn them on so when this side's connected you can just push this side down a little bit just relying on the flexibility of the piece and then I add this little clear piece here which hits this little blue trigger just like that you can hear the click it's kind of similar on this side I just use a different type of piece and so those work and then we have our scroll wheel and this thing actually lights up now that we got our Mouse we need to build a keyboard to go with it for the keyboard I found this really cool kit online now this is not SP I just think it's really cool it's a literal Lego keyboard building kit so it comes with regular keys but then the inside is the actual electronics for a keyboard and it slots together with the Lego system this is exactly what I need so first we take this guy it literally says make a sandwich by installing these things together and then we just put in all the buttons right here they'll just click into place [Music] nice there we go now we got the electronics for our keyboard we're going to start with some plates like this and then we can build up some bricks all the way around this now we put this guy in here this is why you read instructions that you're not going to follow now as you can see we can fit this thing right into here and it kind of slots in perfectly between the bricks then once we have this sealed in we can basically do whatever we want with the design as you can see here I've gone with a very simple design just red with some nice blue details in there also added some slopes to the front of it so it'll be more comfortable when your hands are resting on it I think I mean I haven't really tested this thing out yet but now we got to add the keys oh so [Music] satisfying all right first test dude this is so cool I can customize this to be however I want and whatever color I want cuz it's my keyboard let's add this to the setup here we got our Mouse so we can actually control our computer this will go on mouse pad which I lost and then to actually control the games we're going to need Lego keyboard it has buttons it works I got the sck Lego cable that's USB to USB C so we can do is plug that into there and it fits perfectly and then plug this guy into the side of our computer now we got our mouse and keyboard we're just going to need to add monitors so we can actually see what we're doing next up we have our monitors and these are really high quality monitors since one of these can actually be rotated to be vertical I'm going to make one vertical the other one is going to sit horizontal on the desk but we need to build some cases around these to legoy them and make them fit in with the vi I was going to just build completely real Lego monitors but then I realized it's kind of impossible I'm just basically going to build a case around the outside of the screen and for that I think the best thing to do is to grab some of these little brackets and they can sit on here flush putting studs on the top and the front and if we attach a plate I think we can go all the way around with it when we get to a corner I think we might be able to just do another bracket with a plate attached to it like this yeah nice I'm just going to keep building this up all the way around and then we'll be good to go for the stand at the bottom I'm just going to grab a bunch of red plates and lock them together to create sort of a flat case hopefully that should look pretty good and here it is this is our vertical monitor you can see I kind of just built up the edges with some bricks and tiles just to kind of smooth it out a little bit also added a few slopes and some little gbly details over here by the on button I think if fits the vibe I'm just going to do the same thing on this one but a little bit differently with some different colors just to make it more interesting and also because I ran out of blue and then we can add these to our setup we got our horizontal monitor and then we got our vertical monitor this looks so much cooler than I anticipated in my head I'm going to hook up these monitors with some HDMI cables and then we can build some speakers to go with it first I just got to find some sort of hole that'll fit the opening of this guy I think the best thing to use for this some of these guys perfect so now we have this part where the sound will come out and for the rest of it I'm just going to add Li something that looks nice in some sort of box shape and here we have our beautiful speaker design as you can see we got access to the knob and we just need to duplicate this one more time magic did I just break something probably all right let's set these up we got like surround sound sort of basically it's just stereo we're going to put one on the left and one on the right over here we just need one more thing for this setup before we can actually test it out and play it we're getting pretty close to being able to power this thing on this is my current chair and as you can see it is very short has no back rest and it's hard as a rock in my defense when I designed this I wasn't really thinking of comfort but this thing is like wow this could fall apart at any moment so I want to upgrade the top of this using the same technique I used for the pillow to actually make it comfortable by taking a bunch of Lego Nets and then create a pattern so that it interlocks them together and creates sort of a flexible mesh now this is a really easy technique you just take a net grab some 2 by two tiles what you do is you take one of these and you place four of these little red things on it and then you just stick your net right there now what you're going to do is simple as this and that creates a little flexible section and if we fill the rest of this with those as you can see we've created this flexible fabric So the plan is to take this official Lego blanket and Fold It Up nice and tight underneath the seat then we put the big piece of Lego f fac on top of it it'll be a nice cushy seat we just got to make this thing like 80 times bigger I bought 4,000 of these little red studs to do this so this is going to take a long time but hopefully it's going to be worth it hopefully all right look at that dude now we have a flexible Lego Fabric and it only took like 4 hours to build so we can lay out our blanket and then put this thing right on top and then what we going to do is remove a few of these corner pieces and kind of stitch it together so it makes a pillow shape stop this thing on top of it how does that look for us I wonder how this actually feels all right dude it's like sitting on a cloud like literally I'm sitting on Lego right now and I cannot even tell I think what I'm going to do is just build up and out a little bit with some Technic and then use this little strap I made to create some sort of a back rest to get this back to be sturdy what I'm going to do is use triangles We'll add add a piece here then we can just add another piece right here and lock it into that it'll still be a little wobbly but we can also add some triangles down here to solve that I'm trying to get the back to be like squishy so I built this weird little linkage mechanism just using these gear pieces and it works super well so I'm going to do this again on the other side bro ergonomics last step is just attach this up here to this guy somehow a check that out another thing I wanted to add to this is this Lego webcam it's from like 1980 so the internals won't work with any system or any program so I'm just going to take this apart and put a new webcam in the case and hopefully it should work just the same but the nice thing about this is it has anti- studs on the bottom so we can actually clip it in on top of our monitor also one more thing I didn't forget this highly requested thing we'll just snap into these Technic bricks right here and boom a LEGO cup holder that's just about perfect might fall out almost we ready to power this thing on here we go let's see if this works we got lights it's working yes oh my gosh I'm so excited literally this is so cool this is one of my favorite games brawlhalla this is probably really bad quality but I have a camera right here it's technically a Lego webcam this is so dope you guys the keyboard feels good I'm a console player if you guys didn't know also I don't know why I chose this character ah I died check out combos ooh nice there we go ooh guys this is so cool the Lego mouse is it's all right it's a little weird on the the right click but the regular click I don't know if you can hear that not bad the gaming computer it's not really making any noise what we can do is switch on our Lego fan in here like this get a little bit air flow under there wow that's like the best part of this so far it is hot in here this isn't a very Graphics intensive game so I'm going to up it one notch and then we'll see if the gaming computer will hold up we're going to boot up Minecraft dungeons wow this computer runs really really smoothly how cool is this I think you can shoot arrows right yeah I mean so far everything's working pretty well just the fact that I was able to customize everything for this that's what makes it cool not really like the fact that you're sitting on Lego which isn't super uncomfortable surprisingly the thing that makes it cool it's all Lego and you can make it however you want you can add whatever oh I'm getting killed stop it the keyboard is not bad I really like the design I like the mouse too but not as much the scroll wheel does stick a little I haven't played this game in so long look at that level up we got our large monitor which is nice because I have my recording software here you can see me right there so having two screens works out really well the speakers the sound quality is not bad you can see if I turn this up it's it sounds good you can hear it I'm honestly surprised at how well this gaming chair is holding up literally just look at how soft this is I want to test and see if I can lean back on it let's see not really like breaking right that's called triangles you guys there's some good triangles in there you can't complain with the Lego setup it took a bit to build I think it took like 20 hours or something crazy but yeah it definitely works I'd give this Lego gaming setup a 9 out of 10 just for the comfort factor it is still Lego but it's completely functional huge thanks for watching check out one of these two videos popping up on the screen and I'll talk to you the next brick SS see you"

It took us 3 years to build the PS5 Killer and now we’re conspiring to murder the Pro in less than a week. It can’t be that hard, right? That $200 price bump EVERYONE is angry about gives us A LOT of extra budget when it comes to assembling our brand new PS5 PRO KILLER… Better GPU? What about a new Platform for our Ram and CPU?

3 years to build a $500 PC that could beat the PlayStation 5 and even then there were some compromises and now we're conspiring to murder the PS5 Pro in less than a week it shouldn't be that hard I mean that $200 price bump that everyone is angry about frees up a lot of money for our budget except for one small problem David while $200 is certainly a lot of money it doesn't buy that much these days and while we could have taken the easy path and just thrown a better GPU into our original killer this is LTT we don't play on easy mode when we're done we're going to have upgraded Graphics more features a case that doesn't look straight out of the Fallout universe and the same or better performance than the PS5 Pro but be warned this ain't going to be a smooth ride unlike this smooth segue to our sponsor shut up oh that's my boss yeah okay Ridge if you're dreading the giftgiving season let Ridge help you out with finding that perfect present now for even less that's right their holiday sale is live and you can save up to 47% just by clicking our Link in the video [Music] description I'm not going to lie it was pretty cool when I heard the PS5 killer mentioned by By the Mark cery lead system architect on the PS4 and PS5 even if he was being kind of salty about it I mean to be clear I think he recognized that our Declaration of victory was obviously tongue and cheek and that we do fully appreciate the gaming value that's on display from the PS5 Hardware but he clearly still felt the need to call us out on shortcuts that we used like the fact that we used a secondhand motherboard in our system while comparing it to a brand new disc based PS5 but here's what you got wrong Mary my guy it was all used parts not just to use motherboard so wait no that's worse um and Mr CER wasn't the only one to take issue with that comparison many commenters accused us of giving an unfair advantage to team PC but as you would expect from any coverage of this topic the angry comments came from the other side too with many of you accusing us a favoring team console lonus you said you didn't Place enough value on the extra flexibility of the PC on the free online play or the cheaper larger game library but guys look not every video can be about every topic and today our goal is straightforward we are going to beat the PS5 Pro in visual Fidelity and frame rate at the same price we are still going to allow secondhand parts because yes Mark we do need shortcuts to beat your wonderful machine but but we are going to uncut as many other Corners as possible which means getting the absolute most out of every penny we spend starting with our CPU the Intel Core i5 12400 F and I can already hear you saying lonus Intel for gaming and yeah to be clear the AMD 5600 x would have been our ideal pick and if they were priced identically we would have gone team red just like Sony did for the PS5 Pro but when we can save about $30 and still get a better CPU than what's in any version of Sony's white monolith it's kind of a no-brainer once again we aren't going with the exact specs of the machine we're competing against we've actually got two fewer processing cores but our cores are more powerful than Sony's meaning that in gaming we should come out ahead and the included cooler that's a nice little bonus for additional savings the leap over to team blue comes with other benefits as well now that the LGA 1700 platform has been out for a few years there are some cheap motherboards out there like this ASRock b6m hdv that we found for under $40 now you don't need to go for this one in particular in fact if it wasn't for the outstanding deal we got we would have preferred something with a couple of Gen 4 nvme slots and built-in Wi-Fi but going used means you need to be flexible and snag whatever works and is cheap but hey at least being b660 it does support higher speed XMP memory kits like this one this our 16 gig kit of gskill rip jaw 5 now it's worth noting that because of our CPU choice we could have gone with ddr5 and a ddr5 motherboard but this kit was just 20 bucks and every penny counts especially now that we need to match the PS5 PR's 2 terabytes of storage and we did or at least we were supposed to this is 1 tab it was marked in inventory as 2 tab we're still counting the price of a 2 terab 1 against our total I see okay now you probably noticed this is a pretty decent looking SSD last time around we didn't have a high-end SSD and we Justified our choice by pointing out that it doesn't really have an impact on real world gaming performance but this time we're challenging ourselves to do better and we found something that meets Sony's minimum recommended requirements for a secondary drive and we went with the WD black SN 850x which we found for a little under $75 and which happens to be Tom's Hardware's pick for best PS5 SSD though it should be noted that there are other options out there at very reasonable prices you smell that that's the smell of a right angle get it cuz we didn't cut the corner anymore uh anyway for our case we chose this perfectly decent midsize NZXT h510 that we found for $30 on Facebook Marketplace okay eagle eyes it's not the exact same one but come on what's the point of us buying that black one that someone else could use when we have this white one sitting in our warehouse and besides the point is not the exact case there are a ton of options out there around this price point including some much more fun ones if you don't mind rolling the dice we also found some older model cases that have support for an optical drive if that's your thing but we won't need one this time around because uh the PS5 Pro doesn't have one either thanks for the free right angle comrades of K karagi when it comes to raw power there are any number of power supplies that could do the job but we didn't want a shoddy heartbeat for our Sony Slayer here so after looking through a number of reputable units at the right price we settled on this Corsair cx750 for $35 750 watts yeah that sounds kind of Overkill considering that the PS5 Pro draws less than half of that but we're going to need it to power a GPU that can beat the pro which I guess brings us perfectly to the star of any good gaming PC and also the star of the PS5 Pro if you consider that the GPU changes are the only ones that really impact performance Sony made a big deal out of the big three larger GPU with 45% better raw performance more advanced rracing hardware and a new AI driven upscaling that they call pssr ever since the announcement I've been very eager to get my hands on this bad boy to see what kind of pie C card that's going to translate to in the real world we can make some guesses the closest comparison could be a downclocked 7800 XT but the not yet seen Ray tracing hardware and custom better than FSR but not quite dlss upscaling makes us wonder if we're going to need to wait for amd's 8000 series for a true equivalent one way to avoid giving up features would be to go for an Nvidia RTX 470 because as digital Foundry pointed out its feature set more closely matches the new console but when it came to decision time we felt that this XFX quick 7800 XT with its higher raw performance would make up for the lack of shiny features and help us secure another win for team PC what are we looking at for our total $655 wait really that leaves enough for a sketchy Windows key that 8bit do controller we checked out recently and even some stick locks from LTT store.com to cover those precious analog nubb during transport but uh I couldn't help noticing there's still no Wi-fi 7 H okay well that's a bit of a corner isn't it but but hold on if we built this machine using the absolute lowest prices we found scrapyard War style maybe we could get it at a lower price $535 not bad that's a potential $165 of budget to play with for a Wi-Fi card and I don't know other stuff but would you use the money for lers that's a tough question cuz you're not going to go up another class of GPU and you could upgrade your CPU but that's probably not going to affect gaming performance that much I think the best use of it that's a pretty well-rounded system probably just go for some games speaking of let's do a side by side how close are we here I definitely am seeing some weird moare in my rug me as well oh you are too yeah right now I've set our PC to the PS5 raid Trace performance mode which is the ideal way to play on PS5 base but we probably want to mess with the settings a little bit to get a little more visual Fidelity and see what we can squeeze out um question for you where's oh yeah no we're still getting some Popin from the confetti it looks about the same on both of them honestly when we did the short circuit on the PS5 Pro I didn't find that the PS5 and the pro looked that different in this game and I'm having a hard time picking anything oh the grass your grass is noticeably higher Fidelity than mine yeah okay if I want to catch up I'm going have to change that nothing here looks like it's going to help with that all I can really do is I think it's just resolution and FSR so FSR will be in display oh w w w w wo wo interesting does it look closer to yours right now yeah it cuz we looked I SW I swear when we were looking at before it was hold on okay I'm going back oh now it's poo poo again that's so interesting it's so blurry what do I have to change to make it operate like it does in the menu look at this am I supposed to be able to see what I'm changing no definitely not we're definitely getting 1% lows below 60 raate tracing is on which is definitely not the 7800 xt's you know Forte but that's the trade-off I think in this game we're going to have to say there's an advantage for the PS5 Pro it is an exceptionally well optimized game even on the base PS5 so the PS5 Pro just gets that extra little bit however with that said if you had me blind taste test these I would not object to either of them this is a great experience if you want to play Rift apart I watched something that I've been curious to see for myself and I would be able to tell the difference with pssr for one big issue which is some of its upscaling looks like it's moving if you look at those lines in the deck you can see them kind of like moving and they're not supposed to be like they're supposed to be stationary oh okay so hold on a second see yours are just stationary so there's motion artifacting or something I saw it in a digital Foundry video and I've been curious to see that so we've got some advantages and disadvantages both ways yes I'm just looking at the confetti in there inside yeah I think mine is just going a crap FSR has no idea what to do with it it's pretty Bonkers yeah there's a lot of motion artifacts in it and it's clear that the PS5 Pros upscaling is doing a much better job here like it's really hard but if you can catch one with your eye and try to follow it around you can follow a piece of confetti around yours mine good luck yeah that's just a garbled mess yeah it's pretty bad overall the motion is still there it's moving clockwise or whatever but those are individual objects and that's just it's shredded almost looking my foliage doesn't look way worse than yours here though oh my trees do though that was background yeah the background trees look so flat we I think this is an L I think the PS5 prob might take the win on this one I have everything set to high but I think we're going to want to mess with the settings again I think your menu looks better though like substantially oh oh would you like to enable the pro rendering mode here we go yes we reset these displays right before we started and when we were using them for PS5 versus PS5 Pro on short circuit they looked the same M I thought Windows 11 each chir was supposed to be good [Laughter] you just said you liked mine better that's true hey did I load first I think you might have loaded faster than the PS5 Pro got him oh no just kiding between the two wow that's remarkably close feel like your hair is better but maybe I'm just at an angle it's true I think your textures are worse that's pretty if they are it's not by much dude I think like the photos are a little bit clearer here I don't know if that's a pssr thing cuz it looks like it's doing some weird work on their shirts yeah dude I would rather have the softer photo than the like shimmery line on it it was distracting are you getting a good solid 60 FPS oh yeah this is very 60 FPS e me too looks like your 1% lows are a little bit lower but I wouldn't be able to tell not with any kind of variable refresh rate the fact that we can be this close to the screen and not tell the difference I think tells the story yeah they both look great they both look fantastic I think we could call this a close enough yeah I think we could probably tweak settings and get it a little bit better but you're already at your performance threshold so yeah I think this is as good as it's going to get uh wow this is not good oh wow yeah you're 40ish I'm not even no I don't even think I believe what frame do is saying dude touch this oh yeah that's like sub30 way that's way this is bad the the the pacing here is terrible turn off your raate tracing you know what I'm going to turn vsync off and see if that helps yeah that helps a lot okay okay now it feels like what it says it is the thing about vsync is if you dip below the target frame rate in many cases it will actually have to dip even lower in order to ensure smooth delivery of frames and if you are oscillating between them it can feel extremely stuttery worse than if you just didn't have it at all and in this case this was clearly the right play I'm getting a little bit of tearing but this is way smoother it doesn't look as smooth as yours though once again your HDR pops so much more than mine and for those of you looking at frame view up here and doubting that HDR is working my menu pops like HDR is definitely on on both of these displays it says HDR mode right here Asus gaming HDR trust me we reset them right before we started we did learn when we did the last PS5 killer that Intel's implementation of HDR just plane didn't work because there's a lot of proprietary nonsense that both AMD and Nvidia have baked into their drivers to get the bloody thing working so we could be seeing some of that here it could also be that Windows HDR just plane isn't that great I'm curious kind of come stand on that semicircle want look at the background cuz I getting a lot of that motion upscaling crap in the in the background again yours looks a lot more stable no mine's clean but I think you need to turn down some settings to get to 60 yeah okay I don't like pssr I think it looks bad like look at this tree am I crazy is that like that's no you're not crazy that's a lot worse than mine have a look I expected this to be better than FSR and I think you know well it is better than FSR but it's not better than just if you aren't using as much FSR that's fair I have a more powerful GPU than you yes however it's pretty clear that I'm not getting an even 60 FPS and honestly all things considered I'd probably take that gaming experience really hey I mean here try it that's try swapsies oh yeah all right and I'm not looking at this going wow what a huge difference in visual Fidelity when I'm actually playing the game if I'm not sitting in pixel peeping now these are both more than adequate I would be fine with either of these I think I would be prepared without changing one setting at a time and rebooting the whole game I think I'd be prepared to call this one pretty much a tie yeah it's not quite there I don't think we're quite there but it's pretty close it's pretty close let's close this out by answering some questions is the PS5 Pro as bad of value as people are making it out to be well I think that depends who you are if you have a 1080p display absolutely do not buy this machine if you have a 4K display though and a base PS5 you could get anywhere from 250 to even more for your current machine meaning the upgrade is going to cost you $350 to $450 that is a pretty tough sell the PS5 Pro definitely looks better but from TV distance I feel like like only the Discerning of gamers are going to easily pick the pro out of a lineup with that said if you're coming into the PlayStation 5 ecosystem fresh it's undoubtedly the better machine it's the definitive PlayStation 5 experience and for $250 more it's no worse of a deal as we just showed than spending another 250 bucks on a gaming PC for better Fidelity because I don't really think that our extra couple hundred bucks blew away what Sony was able to do with the extra budget I wouldn't judge you then for going for the PS5 Pro but just be aware that you'll have to factor in an external disc drive if you want to get the best deals on games as we showed recently it's definitely worth the investment if you buy more than a small handful of games each generation the other big question is PS5 Pro versus our PS5 Pro killer PC well if you're the buy everything new sort this machine is going to run you around $900 before tax we're going to have links to all the parts in the video description now over time you might make up that difference in cheaper games and extra utility but not everybody has a couple hundred extra dollars up front which means that the choice is not exactly clear as for our secondhand machine well I think there's a ton of value here I love this machine I love this configuration and I would strongly recommend scrapyard Waring yourself a kick ass gaming rig like this but before Mark Cy calls me out in another interview I fully acknowledge that yeah we killed the PS5 Pro but we also threw sand in its eyes before the fight even started so uh pocket sponsor yeah manscaped while

It's the new $700 PS5 Pro, but this time it is actually worth the price!  This special edition (which will probably be more than $700) is based on the original PlayStation that released back in 1994.  It is meant to simulate the design of the original as a tribute to where it all started for Sony's gaming phenominon, the PlayStation!  I can't wait for it to release on November 7th!

everybody my name is markip and welcome to dumpster Knight lixian latest game and it's made in the scariest game engine of all Roblox this game hello is this multiplayer [Music] said it was single player maybe I just don't know how Roblox Works hope I'm not talking out loud here that would be awfully inconvenient okay well here's the thing I actually don't know at all how to play Roblox it's been a very long time I've done it before I'm not an idiot what did you say you son of a damn it not saying you're wrong but I'm saying I'm wrong if I say that to myself I'm just going to go for it I don't know what's happening I don't like your face okay you made a big mess today time to clean it up put the garbage bags in the dumpster sure all right let's just start fresh hey marbl here back with another Roblox game ready to give you that like and subscription that you already gave to my channel in exchange for beautiful beautiful content what am I saying doesn't matter Roblox Roblox if only Roblox when you say Roblox like a big button said Roblox appears everywhere if it wasn't obvious period that's the end of my sentence all right garbage bags let's just get on with it garbage pick up I picked up whoa well that seems a lot easier than I thought it would be am I going to get hit by a truck I thought I was going to get hit by a truck pretty sure anyway okay seems simple enough sure I just don't like how many openings [Laughter] are that's fine I'm not going to worry about that everything is a okay is there another bag over here oh no hey come back hey come back here hey this is supposed to be easy on me oh oh bush bush bush bush I'm going to get hit by a truck it's all big bait and switch get smashed by a vehicle even farther down huh wait a minute good thing I wasn't walking under that that would have spooked me mea it's all fine it's all very well and good last two wonder what's over there n I'm not going to check it out I'm not a fool how far is this thing you know if I was strong enough I would just carry more than one bag at a time and then I wouldn't have to deal with this problem I was going to say lixian Zoom but lixian is probably not editing this one editors all by your powers combined Zoom that image so that's that's what it takes all right whatever you know what fine this fine take it take that I see a monster and a dumpster I'd just dump it right on their head that'll show them that'll teach him that'll that'll teach him hey stop don't make me make my editor zoom on you editors blow that monster up thank you I have powers that many would consider to be unnatural almost yanked my headphones out of the wall oh I'm slow now I knew I was going to get slammed by a truck all right whatever hey garbage truck wait I got one more bag no no no unless I was the garbage can zooming that way at full speed it might have been [Music] hey all right editors hold back hold back don't blow everything up yet oh oh I see I can't walk on the sidewalk anymore I'm this feels very unsafe hey wait a minute well I I was about to become that outline on the ground oh no okay cut the corners shot all right oh yeah oh I put it in I put it in ah I did it holy holy oh my God yeah oh I Left My Little Secret in the dumpster and no one will suspect a thing probably also I I slam dunked it right in that dumpster I thought that was a dumpster and I was wondering and I slammed e while I was going again anyway who did I murder and why did they deserve it and why are the editors actually to blame for blowing everyone up see the thing is they blow everyone up and turns them into a bunch of pieces and it creates a a bunch of bags how are there six endings in this game I made a big mess today that's that would make a lot of sense as to what that mess was that would make a lot of sense as to what that was peekabo oh you decideed to do this tomorrow you can't avoid it forever can you imagine the smell I can actually actually can I take more than one bag damn damn hey neighbor hey neighbor neighbor hey hey hey hey neighbor hey neighbor all right no you can't run away from what you've done think I can think I just did oh sh that's not what I meant to do I meant to do something else okay there got to be I think this would probably be the same thing where it just like you can't run away away from what you've D okay using my big big brain what the freak using my big big brain I'm going to figure out how lixian brain's working and translate that experience into a cohesive thought and then figure out how these other endings are done I'm so tired oh I'm so tired oh I couldn't possibly do anymore no all right so there's got to be another option to do when I'm throwing it away when I'm throwing it back sko peekaboo it is slightly ah you know I didn't even notice that the first time this is slightly lightly to the right you're creeping I'm watching you when do you move anything different huh ah yeah woo a woa is there anything here anything now anything here and now here and now and how about now H there's every possibility that one of those other doors could open up sometime in the middle of the dumpage you know what I mean oh why is there there's a hey I found a bug found a bug found a bug found a bug there's still something to run into there hey who's doing that [Music] a I forgot about you H I thought the thought the dude whistled at that point apparently not apparently not well one of the endings obviously is just getting killed by the thing before he can run away that's for sure hi now reasonably could one of the other endings be I see that and then I go yeah I'm not doing that no nuh-uh nuh-uh because reasonably I wouldn't want to have anything to do with that but unreasonably I take about the same amount of time anyway all hey hey stop it stop it anybody in the woods anybody in the woods anybody in the woods anybody in the woods anybody in the woods anybody in the woods anybody wood anybody in the woods any Woody in the buds I sure blow him up I forgot forgot about that one going home finish where you started I don't want to but I don't want to but I don't want to please come back okay what if I look before I go cuz it's pretty dark but you [Music] know M uh-huh M uh-huh m m so I haven't found any other the only other thing that I could possibly think of is that I die I get through it without dumping the body parts right cuz there was the possibility that I would have this bag and I didn't get a chance to dump it stop so this is a potential ending where where I just died man thanks lixian for making the thumbnail real easy an eye for an eye a dismembered body for a dismembered body so I'm guessing the other one would be just doing the dang thing but not dumping it at the end right that has to be it that way I I have what I need to I get through the whole game and then I don't dump it at the end and then the last one must be like a Easter egg or a secret one or it's just like I see that face in the dumpster and I run away because there are certain times in games where it's like yeah actually that was perfectly Justified for you to run away at that point I I don't remember hearing that I don't remember hearing the P I don't remember hearing the P anybody else remember hearing the P at that point a very Portuguese pussp you guys ever seen a Portuguese pussp you don't want to in the middle of the night when you hear a Portuguese p in the left of your ear oh that's death that's pure Portuguese Death right there you don't want none of that so I'm not doing it this time but in the next one I'm might to do that where I see that and then I book it out of there I go nope not for me today not on me hey the light also didn't break that time what's that about this one's slightly [Music] different why is it different don't hit me okay for this one I'm running Away really goodly but I'm not going to dump it right definitely right and then if I can't get the last one on the last try I'm going to give up and leave it to you guys I'm sure you guys know the answer hey stop [Music] it oh ye [Music] oh ye okay so the dumpster is right there but I'm not going to throw it in not throwing it in I Didn't Do It I failed at at my objective and I'll never live without regret ah but I didn't do it looks like you brought a piece of me into your home this time I hit and you oh my God that's pretty good not going to lie that's pretty good you know that's pretty good all right so there's only one other thing that I could possibly think of if I can't get it then it's impossible and the game is actually broken which you know no surpris is there it's because it's Roblox not not actually aren't games made in Roblox pretty basic so that be hard to break him I don't know maybe yeah yum yum there's that slam now see I don't know if the if cuz there's two possibilities well hey wait a minute what are you doing there I don't remember seeing you ever what the heck oh never looked up huh interesting also there's a few more lights than I remember they're being on at this point so I look now there's two different things here it could be oh I see you in there and also I'm not doing that but it also might be a trigger that's when it actually slams down you go I'm not doing that I see that and I go right here I'm like no not doing that nope I don't want that I don't want that smoke I don't want any part of that I don't want anything to do with that so I'm not going to do that and by not doing that then I'm good I bet this doesn't do it I bet this doesn't do it woo you've seen enough horror movies to know exactly what's going on you're not dealing with with it although you already started might as well finish it can't avoid it forever that's the last one baby I knew it yeah I don't think so yeah I don't think so I don't think so all right I got them all hell yeah well that was lian's Roblox game Roblox game Robo Roblox game pretty good not going to lie not going to lie that's it thank you everybody so much for watching thank you lixian for making this and uh play for yourself it's all free and stuff and as always I'll see you

standal tragedy must be [Music] averted and for that I need your help it's clearly not a battle royale stand tall the night is far I'm so hyped I really oh my God the nameless King I'm going to come Jiminy Christmas little Pillager bent on sacking the lands of gold I will SWAT away any and all who dare approach band together and prepare to qu that guy just has an eagle for a head that's the most American patriotic I ever [Music] seen so it's not DLC they said it's a standalone so it's a new Elden ring game what the  what I did not expect I did not expect that now you know why I was so excited

awards and it is coming next year 2025 now trust me when I say we are just getting started some of the biggest surprises believe it or not your big by Snoop do and 21 pilots and awards presented by previous winners like Kima and Sam Lake but right now here's news on a new platform for one of this year's Game of the Year nominees deing chaotic time to kick it up a notch I cannot I I'm pretty sure like less than a month ago I was talking about how the next fromsoft project would absolutely not be Elden ring I was saying it wasn't going to be bloodborne 2 it wouldn't be Elden ring it' probably be something totally different how wrong I was that's crazy at last I also thought it'd be another like two or three years but it comes out next year me that type let this hurry there is nothing to fear here that's what scares me yeah the co-op action adventure is what they said so it looks like it's an emphasis on Co-op very cool very cool and the nameless King was there beyond your control I'm in I'm [Music] supering is you a pure one I'm not interested in hiring any more idiots I'm looking for people of tact and vision and perspicacity nothing yet they probably improved it so it'll be fun well I would imagine with the amount of years that have passed since the first one in this one they probably improved it a bit of Game of the Year takes two Joseph FIS the boy the Oscars all right love can't tell you how pumped and excited I am to be here today to show you our next thing I mean I'm telling you at Haz light we have a say where we say we up without up and no no no listen listen this time it's some Next Level  I'm telling you I mean he so likeable going to show you is going to be I know I sign cocky but it's really hard not to be cocking when you have a game like this are you ready all right let's roll hazelight next Co-op Ander go they haven't made a bad game yet super likable dude they haven't made a bad game yet I with them we sure cause a lot of explosions oh chat was right it is called split fiction ready because I'm about to show you Haz light's next coop Adventure called split fiction let me tell you this get ready for a ride you play as Mio and Zoe two aspiring writers that H to get published by a new tech company that can simulate their stories to life I can't do this please calm down it's time shut no accidentally they end up in the same simulation what are you doing in my story something bad is going on here and there they find out that their stories are about to get stolen no one escaped my simulation and in order to save them they have to escape back to reality through the very worlds that they created no I play It Takes Two with Matt they're strangers it takes while Zoe rites fantasy so you will for every level in the game jump between a Sci-Fi world and a fantasy world we T light love variation and you'll have a unique mechanic for every level let me give you some examples in this level you start out by finding dragon eggs that hatch hey stop licking and then they become a little bit bigger dragons with new abilities but in the end they grow up to be full ass dragons C and now you can fly around and kick ass I do wish they would try something a little different though so way out was like a really good groundwork for what it takes to became but this is I don't know this feels like it's just doing the same thing again and that's a little upsetting I would like to see them do something different and you can now attack and different objects here's another one you play as pigs and they later become anyway let's not talk about that level for now and as always with the friends pass you only need to buy one of the their whole thing is Co-op right well their two games were yeah very different kind of games you just get the game but still fundamentally like Co-op couch co-op games P parking tickets time to die excuse me run three what was the a way out it takes two what was the third one what was their third one and look look look wait the good part with this this game is coming out March 6 so you will be playing it in two Mon oh I forgot about brothers that was the one four way out just want to say in the trailer they called me and Zoey that my daughters it's their name they're also in the audience put the camera let them show how cute they are there there hello hey papa yeah of course my my wife is

so much I'm looking forward to be part of this industry I love everybody goodbye awesome Joseph what a guy I spent some time with him in Sweden this summer and and played a few hours of flip fiction it really is everything you'd want it to be a great follow-up to it takes two that Joseph won for game of the year it's been so amazing to have so many game of the year tweeted out that it is a coop survival all right we have much more game awards to come during the show those of you in the US can head to tg.com for a chance to win one of 20 glacier white Lenovo Legion 7i laptops which have the power to handle the latest games Co-op survival this Lenova Legion 7i has the power we need to fin beat the impossible yeah from [Applause] [Music] Twitter are so high I don't know how they're going to do survival for that though except that one I nothing but faith in fromsoft so reach your H the NOA Legion Sony could ruin it brother they haven't been bought by Sony yet they they will likely be bought by Sony in 2025 but it's not going to be Sony's fault if this turns out to be their first [Music] Miss please mhip I don't like it's not like I think it's going to miss though or anything I just don't personally like survival games all that much and I don't know how you even turn elen ring into a survival doesn't really feel conducive to that but again I got nothing but faith in fromsoft to make it good now I still never got in I don't know I never played itd Half Life 3 again half lifee 3 is not going to be announced yeah it's not happening I will eat my goddamn shoe if halflife 3 gets announced tonight it appears Mor's little project is as real as they say this isn't new they already announced Killing Floor the new one this is just more we've we haven't seen this much yet but it's not this isn't like a world premiere announcement that is I'm excited for it the first Killing Floor is the whole reason I got steam in the first place all right we're back here at the game awards and we have so much more to share with you now when we created the TGA in 2014 I wanted to celebrate the people who devote their lives to entertaining and sometimes comforting or affecting us through video games in fact 25 years ago back in college I started writing a series of Articles called behind the games chronicling the velopment of games like halflife and Metal Gear Sol oh you just said halflife please God people behind there's no way it's not happening sad reality is that over the past few years the gaming industry has suffered significant and unprecedented industrywide layoffs those affect the games we get to play and even more importantly the people who make the games we love we can debate and certainly disagree with the reasons why and honestly as a show we we kind of struggle with how to address these Topics in a constructive way but this year inside of these challenges we found greatness I'm proud to share with you the story of a single individual who saw developers in need and did something truly extraordinary meet tga's first ever game changer starting in early 2023 I know nine Souls got snubbed that's what I said started in the games industry nine souls should have been nominated it hurts right it's like bricks what am I supposed to do tens of thousands of Gamers have been laid off at a level that is unprecedented in the industry's history I love this brand I love this company oh my goodness what am I going to do I actually started in games relatively late even though I've loved the industry ever since I was a little child because there weren't games jobs around here I stayed passionate about it and broke through in basically my late 30s I had seen a few friends get laid off off before Thanksgiving and I said to my wife Jess like this is unacceptable hi everybody it's Amir and I'm here to help support you as you look for your next opportunity in video games I can't imagine what it must feel like for someone have to go to their family around the holidays and say I don't have a job I don't know what's going to happen I had a robust background in things like data analysis and I said well I can do something with this I started a community with one resource we just started putting together a list of all the job open openings out there and over iteration after iteration and ended up becoming a suite of several different resources we have 2300 coaching volunteers who've given people over 50,000 Community coaching conversations for free he pure pro bono Amir there is no payment he doesn't take anything back from the community I'm proud to say we've helped Place nearly 3,000 people in jobs Amir is like career Santa Claus if it work for Amir and for this community I wouldn't have even known this job was here he has

tech industry because of the over hiring from all the blow without great people it is a real shame across the entire tech industry really that's mismanaged companies for you proud of so many of you who have already joined me to make an impact and I really have to thank everyone in our community who gave all actually just contributed to that 277 uh jobs lost here tonight for this aming celebration I challenge everyone to ask themselves what more can we each do to make our industry better I dedicate this to my grandparents in heaven and to our game awards watch party back home my

industry as a kid from Farmington Connecticut it felt a world away not anymore thank you very very much thank you thank you refreshing Ubisoft is fading away uh not all the PE like yes and no Ubisoft sucks yeah but the people that are making it  aren't leaving they're not getting fired it's the people at the top making these stupid projects of the old world the people that are getting canned are just like the people who are forced to work on the project so nothing's going to change that's the problem the promise of our civilization it sucks forging Souls into steel turning hope into a hunt for the fate of humanity so any good games yet I didn't think so what are you talking about man they just showed a new Elden ring game I don't know why people seem so desperate to be like oh oh no

[Applause] too you think subnotica 2 will be here [Music] maybe it just doesn't really seem like it's different though you know what I mean this feels like OverWatch one to OverWatch two like it's a different engine right I'm pretty sure they changed the engine but fundamentally it's still the same have you seen the devs play spli gate they're cracked oh yeah they're nuts at it I've seen that hey would Farm events are weaving together quickly now Rook the fate of the world shall be decided soon it will not you said it was good why change it just needs another crack at it yeah but if you put in

some point I've had the privilege of participating since the very first TGA and I've witnessed how the role of TGA has grown every year not only does it celebrate the achievements of those involved in the gaming industry but it has also evolved into an event that brings together IND from around the world what was that focusing deeper anyone else hear that was that me f what was that as a bridge not just within the gaming industry but also between gaming and other Digital entertainment such as film television anime and music this role will undoubtedly become even more important important in the

of the humans did you really expect something different no I never do but I'm constantly disappointed like there is so much cool you can do with anime property in games yet they always do the same three things either a completely worthless Arena fighter or a gotta game or a mobile game and that's that's it that's all it ever is except for Dragon Ball like fighter Z even like sparking zero like the 10 kichi series continuation like at least those are different it's such a waste it's such a waste power your dreams Advanced by AMD code Bane well code V is not based on an anime code Vin is just

boss thank you listen kid I'll see you on the other side [Music] [Music] sh [Music] it is pretty big this is their first new IP in a long long time [Music] Intergalactic the heretic profit hey that's pretty cool there you have it Intergalactic the brand new franchise from Naughty Dog and PlayStation byman and starring Gabrielle as Jordan M I'm also happy to share that the trailer you just saw and the full game a new original score from Trent resner and adus man Trent resn has been doing so many soundtracks he did one for Warframe recently too can't wait to learn more thanks to naughty dog and Playstation for that special announcement and now to present bigest honor of the night over the past decade 10 distinguished titles have been recognized as game of the year please welcome last year's winner from laran Sven [Music] [Applause] vinka all right Wukong let's take home this St I realize you guys have been sitting here for over 3 hours but I still have some time credits from last year to cash in so so it turns out that not only will I be the one who will know as first which game wins tonight they actually also know which game is going to win next year the year after and the year after now how do I know this well an oracle told me she said change is coming it's a modern Oracle so they made me sign an NDA but I trust all of you I know you can keep a secret you will never leak it the Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by studio studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage it's stupidly simple but somehow it keeps on getting lost Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves they created it because it hadn't been created before they didn't make it to increase market share they didn't make it to serve as a brand they didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off sounds like to me those targets and furthermore the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything who's only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design they didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet they didn't treat their players as users to exploit and they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics they knew that if you put the game and the team first the revenue will follow they were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun hey congrats to Ubisoft you did it fun nobody was going to have fun it sound just like that understood the value of respect that if they treated their developers and players well those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned but above all they cared about their game because they loved games it's really that simple said the Oracle winning game of the year turned out to be a lifechanging event for us it was an amazing thing to those who will win game of the year 2024 you have no idea what's waiting for you it's an incredible honor and you're in for a heck of a ride now remember should you be told to wrap it up for tonight you can always come back next year and chat for three minutes okay so now to pay tribute to the nominees nominees for game of the year once again Laura B and the TJ Orchestra unironically though there isn't a bigger honor for games I I will always be kind of surprised when someone like Nintendo decides to just do direct for their announcements as opposed to this because directs don't pull 1.2 million concurrent viewers on one stream accumulative 3 million viewers like I it really is like the best Stage for like announcements and stuff and the award really is pretty meaningful now [Music] yeah flute guys going crazy I appreciate it Kaz [Music] every time they switch to him it's a different instrument that he's got that man's got like a doom weapon wheel that he's just switching to for instruments [Music] it's going to cut to him again this time he's ham [Music] boning what is that thing man had a modified kazoo he's he's inventing instruments on the [Music] spot he's blowing into a clown no that's a goddamn Penny [Music] Whistle I already saw his newest weapon that thing oh my [Music] God look at that instrument he's holding right there it looks like a weapon an Elden ring boss would use come on Wukong I think it's going to be astrobot like I said I think I think it'll probably be astrobot game of is but I'm pulling for Wukong please asol damn it I told you though damn [Applause] it he hey I did tell you beforehand I called it I I called it Astro bot's a good game I like astrobot a lot Wukong is my game of the [Music] year music goes hard yeah music goes hard it's a good game I think it's a very good game but I still personally like Blackmouth Wukong [Applause] [Music] more wow nothing can prepare you for that thank you so much I'm thinking once again to all the ases back in Japan you know all 65 of them right now they're crying so please a round of applause for them thank you it's you guys as well um you know when I thought about you know why this game you know give people joy and smiles on their faces I think he came down to the people is night rain already on doing exactly that I think you know the when I think of the team is the amount of generosity they gave they put the user first always you know never thought about any you know any calculation it was just about the kids especially because we had this huge huge privilege to be potentially the first game to be in the hands of children and we know what it means very much um so timas be really uh from the bottom of our heart you know well done and thank you so much now thank you I have to thank a few more people because a lot of people contributed to this game of course in si and Playstation of family the studio a chance and Scott Roy who really believe in Astro even before we did Ken Chanel marketing and many many other people that I'm not mentioning you know astrobot is full of 30 years of PlayStation history and actually a lot of people in this room tonight gave their characters their IP without asking anything in return should have been BMW celebrating 30 years to them as well you know from theot of thing from the trailer you still talking about the trailer and then last and not least and you want to stay for this one because I didn't plan to say it but I'm going to say it anyway you know Platformers you know PlayStation 30 years and we made a platformer which is great it's very nostalgic and and fresh at the same time but let's not forget that if even before PlayStation they were people making Platformers in 1989 Christmas and I got a gr box okay you could just say again backed in he was Super Mario Brothers and he was really really great so we are in Japan we're in Tokyo they are in Kyoto but I want to pay tribute to the company who really put like Platformers and showed us Innovation and quality consistently and inspired us to actually make the game that we made so that's also and I've managed not to mention them have you noticed but you all know who they are and many other companies have been inspired over the years so that's really very important and we want to Tri you know pay tribute to them um tonight so From The Bottom Of Far thank you so much it's amazing and uh we'll see you again thank you so much Nintendo going to sue them now imagine it's not off the table [Applause] congratulations astrobot and that is going to do it for our 10th anniversary of the game awards more than anything I hope tonight made you believe the future of our medium is brighter and greater than ever congratulations to the winners and thanks to all the incredible teams around the world who shared their upcoming work with us today putting together this show has been so special to our team personally and professionally thanks to all of you from seen it looks great we'll see you back here at the peacock theater for the game awards 2025 our 12th show live on Thursday December 11th 2025 thank you happy holiday that's true Wukong won Players voice that's not the same as game of the year the they announced was actually unbelievable probably the best announcements I've seen at one of these shows but I am disappointed Wukong didn't win not going to idea really wanted to see him do [Music] it so you're in dispatch yep I'm in dispatch again I don't know what I'm allowed to talk about with the game or not so I'm just going to I'm not going to try and go into detail and get in trouble for it but yeah I'm in the game with Aaron Paul and actually a really cool cast I didn't see who they showed in the credit so I don't know who else I'm allowed to say but yeah it was cool no there were some really good there were some really good announcements unironically we had some heaters you think there's any chance GTA 6 doesn't win game of the year next year well I mean I haven't played the game yet maybe it's bad I doubt it but maybe starting with Witcher 4 was insane they had a crazy combo they went Witcher 4 into did they go Witcher 4 into the uh Team ieko trailer or was there one in between oh that's right they went Witcher for into Elden ring night rain then team iiko they had a like they had a crazy intro of announcements yeah and then ending it with the new Naughty Dog IP what announcement surprised you the most honestly Virtual Fighter I didn't think anyone even remembered Virtual Fighter so the fact that they're even doing a new one blew me away but I think the team iiko surprise is probably going to be the best surprise oh actually maybe Okami because Okami also it sounds like they revived Clover Studios I still am not super clear if they revived Clover for that which would be nuts because Clover eventually became Platinum games so it'd be crazy if they just rebooted clover Okami is a masterpiece of a game though really so the fact they're doing a new one this many years later great hopefully they don't fumble it yeah fluke guy is awesome he's always cool perhaps show yeah what do you mean KQ you going to play your own game when it releases let's be clear it's not my game I'm just in it that was actually the first time I actually even saw what it looked like but yeah I probably will well I'm definitely going to play it I don't know if I'm going to stream it that might be kind of weird I don't know what I'm allowed to say about it I play a decently sized role I'm not just a cameo so it would be kind of weird for me to stream it because then I'd be listening to myself in game imagine you got nominated for best performance yeah imagine my character I get best performance nomination over the  crazy cast of like Aaron Paul and others I don't know if I can name that would be nuts hey man I went crazy for it they took a line where they wanted me to be monotone there but I man I was I gave a passionate performance for the character I don't know if I can say the character no I'm not I I'm not exaggerating I really do think they had some Banger announcements here I'm just going to pull up the whole list because I know I'm already forgetting some like they even had they had a Oni Musha they have a new Oni Musha that game that they just showed like come on man that's crazy told you there'd be no halflife three what did I tell you no halflife three no bloodborne 2 no silk song told you no one has a list compiled yet for all of them no I'm not just going to eat my shoe for no reason true Y no GTA either you called that one I said I think there is a chance that they will do GTA 6 I thought there is a chance and turns out I was wrong check out the new check out the new articles about night rain they explain the game in detail yeah I might as well do that real quick seamless Co-op mod we're talking about here I never played that mod maybe they have bloodborne at the end of the credits like a mar whole movie yeah perhaps Intergalactic going to be one of the most expensive games ever did you see the product placement of course I saw the product placement that's the first thing they showed in that was Porsche Porsche The Vibes get even stranger when you see a battle royale style wall of deadly rain encircling the map and characters dashing around on foot like the wait what no way night rain is Elden ring turbo condensed three-player Rog likee with a little dash of Monster Hunter to it as you choose a final boss to face at the end of a 30ish minute run that's assuming you survived two days of the circle shrinking to focal points where someone in alt limb grave each night culminating in its own tough boss battle I don't really love that what no it doesn't even sound like a boss Rush that sounds like um man I can't think of the custom game but it literally sounds like someone's mod that they would make yeah I know miyazaki's not on it that's what chat was saying but even still that that just seems like such a blatant cash grab I I don't I don't like that I mean maybe again I have nothing but faith in fromsoft in general but that direction I'm not super stoked on when I first started my when I started my first session by dropping on the map from a spectral bird the entrance was so fortnite coded I wondered if from software was joining the live service party with a battle pass seasonal event in $20 epic skins so that's what the bird was that they showed that's their that's their like battle bus dropping oh me oh yikes we wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase so everything is unlockable it's not what we'd consider a live service game we're still in the process of thinking about possibilities huh no PVP elements at all no invasions no esoteric multiplayer Covenant we wanted to have a sense of accomplishment oh oh oh you don't use you don't put those words together you never put those words together ever uh-uh that's bad you never put sense of accomplishment like that from each defeat and each success we wanted this to be different from Elden ring and past titles winner lose you'll end run with relics you can equip in future sessions offering a range of Buffs to HP magic or even basic actions found one Relic that made my healing flask also heal my allies a huge benefit we only had we only had four to qua before before running dry is qua I don't know that word I'm not man I'm I'm a little worried this might be from sof's first Miss son of a oh I don't like that direction no and this isn't even Sony's fault this is before they're getting bought out by Sony the streak is over yeah the streak is over I guess well okay I'm counting my chickens before they hatch but man I like how do you even make that good that is like the antithesis to a Soul's experience like I think you can make a Rog likee work I think you can make Rog likee work what I'm not convinced you can make work is a battle royale influenced Boss Rush check the interview about it on the official site let me see on the Bandai site is is it just on Bandai yeah it's fair smile I think that's a fair take okay this is just a trailer where is the interview thanks membership Arc no look up Elden ring night rain website it's a Japanese website oh it's I'm not bandai's website well that didn't work it's on IGN membership slash this game is a huge surprise to me I can imagine it's going to be a huge surprise to fans next week so I'd really like to hear about the initial of concept and how you kind of came up with the idea for the game uh I don't really care about the idea all that much because the concept's not great I don't really care how he came up with the idea for it I enjoy a whole manner of games Shooters to board games and MMOs so basically we're taking inspiration from a wide range of genres and titles it almost feels like your speed running especially with wall jumping and stuff like that I'm wondering if speedrunning Community has also been an influence on the creation of this game as well it' be AOW to say there's nothing like that that's inspired night rain or that there's some inspiration there I enjoy elements of not just Souls game but other games where you have these challenging elements or speedrun tactics it's not just applied to speedrunning it's like optimizing the gameplay from the player perspective how to best optimize the experience and get the most out of it and clear it in the best way possible or quickest way possible I enjoy element I enjoy those elements and I feel like this is a good opportunity to share my love for that with the players glad if this sort of idea is coming through a night rain has Miyazaki son had any input in the game or is he strictly hands off on the project initially I took the idea to Miyazaki San who gave it the green light he was a little he was a little involved in that initial concept phase of the game but after that he gave full rain to me think of it as an Elden ring spin-off first and foremost isn't looking good it's it's not it's it's not it's not sounding good but I guess we'll see man I'll give fromsoft the benefit of the doubt they haven't let me down yet but this this feels like something I'd expect them to do under Sony to be honest but it's not Sony this is this is something they just decided to do re should Idol rewatch the trailer I kind of don't want to now cuz I was pretty hyped watching the trailer like seeing nameless King go back in there and now knowing what I know about like the bird being the  battle bus I don't know if I want to watch it again maybe Drake maybe someone already played it on YouTube oh I definitely can't watch that if it's leaked voice crack leaked gameplay that shit'll get taken down so quick I don't know about that technician that'd be a terrible idea wait to Battle Royale it has Battle Royale elements shrinking Zone battle Bus Drop there's a virtual fighter direct starting in 35 God that's so late and I'm starving I don't know if I'll watch that I'll probably just watch it when I'm done not on stream though UFO crashed in New Jersey apparently check Reddit N I don't know about that I'll check though I know about all the oh my God drones in New Jersey we're talking about that before the game awards but I doubt there's a spaceship crash which subreddit the uip subreddit on there right now oh yeah an hour ago police dispatch to drone crash in Morris let's see oh there's no footage of it they just have the uh oh here 1329 suff what was the exact call was saw crash or crash for theer drones fell out of the sky by the power lines behind their house and then 10 more show up nice well we might see some aliens too imagine that the game awards not only has announcement out the Wazoo but then brings us aliens what what a night huh what a night all right I need to eat I am so  hungry I think I'm G call it there all right thanks for tuning in appreciate the generosity this was the biggest stream I've ever done peaked at 110,000 viewers on YouTube and and it's like 20 something thousand on Twitch it's crazy I expect every single one of you to come into every single stream now I worked hard on the game awards so it's good that this is my biggest stream I really I really put a lot of effort into watching this one so it's good to see that it that it played out big for me all right everyone have a great rest of the night sleep well I'll see you tomorrow bye-bye"

Ben Azelart (aka @BenAzelart) is one of the top YouTubers on the planet who is known for building crazy rooms, but now he's starting his own gaming channel! He has been gaming on a subpar setup so I decided to surprise him with his dream gaming room! This was absolutely insane to make because we only had a short amount of time to make it happen. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! Ben loved his new room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

Not my friends room was messy so I Built His DREAM Room, But my parents told me to clean my room So I Built Their Dream House, But I Built a Soccer Stadium in My House, But I Built 4 SECRET Rooms You'd Never Find or any other video like FrenchieFries, Ben Azelart, FaZe Rug, Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, Papa Jake, FilmDice, LOL Team, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, or Airrack would make.

biggest YouTubers in the world and he's about to start a brand new gaming channel but there's one massive problem his gaming room needs a major upgrade so I'm going to be able to surprise you with a new room first I you to get out of here so it's actually a surprise I have a video to film in my house where we're building something crazy I'm counting on you see you I don't know how long we have until Ben gets back here so we need all the help we can get I'm going to bring this guy to life oh this is sick now that we have Noah here I think we need some more help me and the team are going to be completely transforming this room but first we need to clean it I guess I ran out of edits we actually have to clean this I've seen Matthew's videos and I know what he's capable of so I have some pretty high expectations for what he's building Matthew do not let me down please now that we have Ben's room all clean we can start transforming it and since we have this Jester basketball hoop I'm going to call jesser and see what we should put inside the room I need your help we're trying to build the craziest gaming room ever I want to know what you put inside okay Ben he's a good friend of mine definitely need LEDs at the top of the room triple monitor 12 TVs whichwich PlayStation grass Xbox B's going to be back soon one more thing one more thing one more thing it needs a hidden entrance bro it's Ben a we're going to start off by covering this wall right here and building a hidden entrance that leads to this room later on we're going to build a giant skate ramp that starts up here and ends all the way down there and since we're adding a hidden entrance over there nobody's going to know how to get to a skate park [Music] perfect we just installed this Custom Door and soon we're going to cover with a hidden entrance but it's super dope check it out it's an automatic sliding door and soon it'll be completely hidden speaking of hidden rooms back at Ben aar's house he was showing us why we have to build a hidden entrance in his gaming room I have built a bunch of secret rooms in my house because I love secret rooms so let me show you one this is the first entrance and then we also have another one right here these both go into a room where we built a zoo a movie theater and a secret pool so yeah I love secret rooms now that we have the framing on this wall in place we're going to cover it with a cool luxury wood finish this wall is looking really good we're going to add some paint to it and a giant stay Wild logo right there I do love soccer and we are building a stadium in my house so there's one thing that I could ask for it would be a mini Jumbotron you know like the things at the stadiums like where they put all the players on them oh I actually forgot my laptop at the warehouse I'm going to grab that real quick you you have to go to the warehouse yeah real quick are are you are are you are you sure I'm I'll be right back just walk that when I leave okay okay are you you really just leave Ben coming back to the warehouse wasn't a part of our plan this room is about to transform and look so good wait you that is that Ben what's that close the door Ben's here he wasn't supposed to be back yet why is he back I'm going to go talk to him I wasn't expecting you to get home so early what do you mean I had to grab something I just wasn't expecting you to be here okay what's the what's the problem I just don't want you to see the room why can't I see it a surprise I'm just kid I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm not going to look at it I'll go in this room you go in that room okay okay don't peek okay fine whatever I'm not going to peek with B back it's going to be a lot harder to keep this a secret this wall is looking so good and we're getting ready to add a giant stay wild LED sign right there but before we do that let me fill you guys in on a little secret I have so this wall looks completely normal but once you press right here we have a hidden entrance hi how long you been staying there uh a couple hours the only issue is Ben's walking around his Warehouse right now so I got to carry the sign upstairs without him seeing Ben's Warehouse is so massive I forgot where we parked our truck I think it's over here somewhere uh-oh so this is supposed to say stay wild but it looks like it broke off on the drive the entire W is broken right here that's broken now we're going to have to completely start this sign over make something new much better now I'm going to paint it oh I think it's backwards there we go now it's time to paint [Music] it I'm not going to lie I'm extremely scared to let this go considering it's already been broken once you ready 3 2 2 1 the best part about this is we actually installed LEDs on the inside so it glows it's time to check this out here we go that's sick that looks crazy we can control this and make it any color watch [Music] this now it's red red we don't know our colors this wall with the hidden entrance is looking crazy but if we move on to this side over here we're going to add a bunch of tiles across this entire wall with a giant skateboard sticking out of it it's going to looking SN let's get to it this is looking really good but we have like 10,000 more to go hey uh Erin you uh you got a you're doing a great [Music] job now that the tiles are on this looks amazing so we purposely left a broken piece in the wall right here and that's because we're getting ready to add a skateboard making it look like it slammed into the wall let's go grab it all right we going to put this perfectly into place ready yeah all right let's go yo that actually looks so sick this is definitely my favorite feature inside the room so far the fact that the wheels actually spin is dope so now what we're going to do is add a nice comfortable couch right here so people can hit their head on the skateboard I'm just kidding we strategically made it tall enough since we have a giant skateboard inside of this room now we're going to go out there into his warehouse and build a giant skate park that he can use he's going to love that Ben loves skateboarding he literally has two ramps inside of his Warehouse already but he asked me if we could build something much larger so we're going to start way up there and have it go all the way down here unfortunately we can't start building our ramp until the old one's gone I think Ben's filming on the other side of the wall hopefully he doesn't hear this what is going on in there yo if we're going to take this ramp down quickly without Ben noticing we have to do it much faster that's why I brought no in he's much smarter than me let me use my head let me show you how it's done a these guys are [Music] pathetic guys please I'm trying to film something that worked why are they jumping around what is Matthew yeah what are you guys doing we're just trying to build your room real quick give me like an hour of like a little bit less than all right I got you we'll be quiet okay I'm like excited to see the room but I just got to film this real quick and then you can keep the noise okay oh I was not expecting Ben to get back to the warehouse this soon this is extremely hard to do this without him hearing or seeing it we're trying to build this ramp as quiet as possible so we don't ruin Ben's video in order to build a skate ramp we need two identical pieces that we can put next to each other and then we'll have boards going all the way down so it's actually strong we just installed some of the framing on our skate ramp and I brought in a special guest to help us finish it what do we got to do to finish it don't put my hand like that oh yeah oh okay lunch time this is just the first part of our ramp we're going to add three other sections this entire thing is supposed to be a surprise but Ben keeps texting me that there's cameras all over his Warehouse out here and he keeps trying to Chuck them so maybe we should go unplug them he has so many rooms inside of this Warehouse I actually know where it is really I'm not even kidding where uh it's in the main room main lobby space there's a door it's got a lock on it though were you snooping around his Warehouse maybe it looks like the cord to the security camera monitors is right down here I just unplugged all of the cameras and Ben's warehouse now Ben has no way of seeing what we're doing until I actually surprise him at the end of this video after getting all the panels on it's time for Uncle Dave to test the ramp me and know Hold You Ready set go what cute beat okay okay we broke it is that the board or the it's the ramp kill the ramp it'll buff out after fixing the hole Uncle Dave made we started painting that's going to hold on to your head yeah do it you broke my little glasses oh they broke gosh I can't see Ben's ramp is looking amazing but it's missing his iconic cheetah print let's do this [Music] thing now it's time for our first skate ramp test we're going to be using this guy right here I think he might need this first here we go buddy all right here goes nothing editors go ahead and Photoshop Ben ard's face on this good luck [Music] Ben now let's try it with the real dummy wait wait wait wait before you guys do that I have a challenge what whoever can blast the target using zuru's xshot Insanity lineup going down the ramp with a skateboard gets $1,000 since none of us are good at skating we're going to be sitting as we go down but later in this video benard's going to attempt to go down the ramp and jump over us with a skateboard you got it didn't even [Applause] know I forgot to shoot shoot you can't get me the XR sanity lineup is designed to blow your mind with unmatched power and performance did you miss yeah I missed again nice try shy this R looks terrified from up here I can't wait to see Ben go down on the skateboard the X joh sanity the lineup features four different blasters the manic berserko mad Mega barrel and the motorized rage fire we need a bigger Target somebody get me a pizza with the Exon sanity lineup you can combine all of the blasters into one mega blaster who wants it Aaron's too scared to go down with the skateboard so we'll save that for Ben asart later I'm going to get you w I got him don't miss out on the xshot and Sanity range click the link in the description to get yours now honestly this is terrifying there's only one person on our team that could actually go down this our camera no no that's intimidating I'm good I'm good I'm great I think I'll just take the camera back with the new insane ramp build it's time to continue work on Ben's Dream game so this is the room that Ben's filming in I have to be quiet since he's filming right now and this is the room we're customizing there literally wall to wall we have to be careful that he doesn't see anything and we got to be really quiet if you're ever watching one of Ben's videos and you see this wall right here just know this message is behind it cuz we're about to cover with giant cabinets so I saw this really cool room design from the streamer ninja and that's what we're going to be taking some inspiration on this back wall we're going to be adding custom giant cabinets and shelfing for B to display all of his YouTube trophies and anything else he wants on this back wall we're taking Uncle Dave upstairs to the room to help us finish it Hey where's the elevator oh there is none we're transforming this place can't we out an elevator this is Uncle Dave's first time seeing the room so we're going to get his reaction to see if he likes it I'm digging it nice and square yeah like a Big Mac or fries it's a hidden door now pull on it oh smooth need your help installing cabinets don't drop it can you reach is your phone ringing right now no no I have every time I have have an idea it goes ding hey you ever help us or you just film I just [Music] film we have this beautiful custom vinyl that we're going to be installing on Ben shelves we chose pink because it's Ben's favorite color you you almost hit me twice dude I'm sorry let's get started oh now that we have these cabinets looking beautiful it's time to hang them into place Ben personally picked out this color and sent it to me so he's going to love it inside of this room y Matthew so I know you're working up there and I know you're almost done we're very close to your done but I kind of have a request for a few things I is it too late to ask I mean it depends on what you want I want a water fountain where you can drink anything out of it Prime lemonade fruit punch like anything okay cuz you know when I'm thirsty up there it's nice and then a mini Jumbotron okay like you know those things in the stadium like where you watch like the game like all four screens I want like a small one in the middle fortnite on that one Mario Kart on that one I should probably go over here and start working on this yeah like but remember water fountain and then the mini Jumbotron please that is quite the challenge and we still haven't even done anything for this wall yet this is where his setups and monitors and ps5s are going to be but before we do that we're going to handle the challenges starting with the water fountain that sprays fruit punch so me and Noah just completely filled this water fountain with time's brand new flavor you ready to try it out yes here we go let's see if it works 3 2 1 we officially have a prime water fountain this is so dumb oh splashing my eye I like my cheese drippy bro but not my water fountain we're going to have to fix this no one's catching all the liquid so it doesn't get on bed floor think that one went his eye I'm going to go fix this hurry back okay bro I'm back I'm back oh it's cuz this isn't tightened right here oh oh a I didn't expect a shower with that either we forgot to glue it that's okay the good news is we know what the problem is we just have to glue this pipe right here and everything will be fixed no more leaks perfect we successfully accomplish one of bench challenges we'll get to the scoreboard in a second but first we're going to address this wall right here the really cool thing about these panels is they serve two purposes they look amazing and they're also soundproof for good recording quality I can't hear pretty sure Ben heard that downstairs what let's put these panels in place okay walking around Ben aar's Warehouse he has a ton of different rooms with grass and green Vibes so we're going to make a giant grass wall right here with LEDs on the back it's going to look sick we got to get this in the room before Ben sees it this is actually so heavy right now you guys are doing a great job though you guys are doing great I can't live that that's all them we got this fresh thing of grass right here that we're going to throw in the wall literally I don't think that did anything Matt okay perfect now we just have to screw it into place so it doesn't do [Music] that how cool would it be if we put a giant custom Bassler LED sign right here it would be really cool but we didn't make one I've got my ways I got to make sure I'm not spotted while I'm doing [Music] this you look ridiculous right now hello hello there I don't see anybody over there did you hear that so loud all right go go go go all right come on no let's go let's go let's go let's go okay go go go go you're looking for something oh yes now that we made some more progress it was time to see what our head Builder Uncle Dave thinks smells like real grass so Even's got a water fountain here bro it's Kool-Aid no it's actually Prime oh Prime from the screen to the king to the ring I like my cheese drippy bro I think you watch way too much Tik Tok we have this incredible custom built scoreboard that we made but unfortunately it's really heavy and we got to bring it all the way over there so we got to be very careful because there's literally TV screens on every single side you don't want to break now I have to just install it up on there tighten it it's so heavy just hold on tight it's almost there one more turn and done all right we're going to let go in three 2 1 yo the coolest part about this screen is there's LEDs all around it check this out hey Aaron could you press the button so I look cool oh s sorry about that now Ben has his very own scoreboard inside of his room that he can watch TV or play video games on [Music] now that we have the sports drumotron I'm officially calling this room stay wild Stadium but notice how I didn't call it a gaming room that's because there's no setups right here we're going to add an epic setup right here with a PS5 Nintendo switch Xbox gaming computer am I missing anything snacks snacks I can't wait to get Ben's reaction at this room I feel like it's missing something though I don't know what H maybe a monitor oh yeah that'll look good this chair is so so happy bro woo what do you think of

report of the events that I'm experiencing at the moment several weeks ago station number two and station number one became the sources of uncontrollable burst of energy there was a malfunction on

stone or sand or even something scattered in the air oh I can hear the good old Ron beeping it's not a bad detector at first but it can be inaccurate if there is more than one anoboy nearby basically once you get an taxis I recommend you buy a better one rumor has it that when the first time came the Rogue wastelands were altered by something similar to a huge laser Ray to put it simply artifacts

[Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] hello everyone my name is Matt Marshall and I'm the solo developer of dystopic a minimal relaxing and Darkly cozy city building sandbox for future cities there's no management there's no goals just build sculpt create and enjoy a bit of cyber Punk Zen in your day it's intended to be a small creative but meditative experience like a freaky little cyberpunk bonsai tree right in your computer I wanted to capture that feeling of wandering vast cities and getting lost in the heavy rain and the fog and the noise and the traffic and finding some peace of mind in those otherwise chaotic environments using a combination of districts you can place sculpt and shape your city buildings and districts have a range of effects and connections to explore and create as you build the city will fill with Dynamic lights and procedural traffic you can also customize weather time of day and even the soundtrack to find just the right mood use the light brush to inject a bit of energy and life into your city and with a variety of props and decorations you can really make it something unique and special for you there are giant towering Holograms launchpads blimps signage and many other things to unlock over time as you play you can even bring in your own images to the Billboards make your future city a shrine to your cat like I've done here for RONA flipping over to photo mode you can create spectacular and creative photos with camera environment settings and a range of filters and controls at your disposal when I was growing up I always played city builders and simulators with cheat codes on on just creating the cities I wanted to and taking in the soundtrack and nothing more and I wanted to capture that experience for other builders like me who love to create epic Horizons and not fiddle with City budgets or citizen happiness meters dystopic 1.0 is coming soon and this is really just the departure point for what is a passion project for me I'll be updating it over time with new content quality of life improvements and maybe some mod support features thank you so much for taking a look at dystopic and please wish [Music] this biohaz detected [Music] oh that's what I call a dramatic entrance there's a reason why I'm called killer bean it's because I'm good at what I do really really good I used to be an assassin for the shadow agency an international organization powerful enough to shape the world until they lied to me and tried to kill me now I'm going to destroy them you're the G Dar idiot who wants to take down the shadow agency well it is sure nice to meet you before you die they made me who I am and I will make them pay for [Music] [Applause] it one where I Paul atres was never born I created the future until it created me but I see a narrow way a path that might have been what if my mother had obeyed her orders and given birth to a girl everything would change Dr UA exposed before his betrayal a world where my father lives house at trades surviving the Battle of arakan Sardar deployed to protect the spice mange a war of Assassins spreading across the planet [Music] freman exterminated no madep no lean alib no quizat hak all of my Visions lead to horror except for this one this one leads to you [Music] [Music] yeah a [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no [Music] [Music] a [Music]

back before it's too late [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] n [Music]

Ever since I was a kid, I have been obsessed with super heros and as I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), I even built a life-size Batmobile out of cardboard. I’m taking things to the next level in this video by making the worlds first real life Batmobile and command center! This was an insane journey and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

If you’re reading this you’re a real one! Comment ‘’I want a Batmobile!"" so I can notice you!

room my friends have been editing all of my videos for the past 2 years and thanks to Spin Master I'm making this the most insane room ever but before we surprise you guys with your new room we need to get you out of here so you don't see what we're doing oh jeez where are you sending us this editing room is massive but it needs a lot of work there's a mouse back here a oh the only bad news is we don't have a lot of time to transform this room before our editors get back so we need to be as quick as possible as we were cleaning up the space I came with the perfect room design all of the crazy work that our editing team puts into the videos they're the real life superheroes so we're going to make this room themed to Batman now that we have this room all clean we can start transforming it and since this plant's name is Ben I'm going to call my friend Ben AAR and see what we should put inside of here since what did we need that plant you built some of the craziest rooms on the planet I want to know what we should put inside of this room you definitely need lots of LED lights huge TVs gaming consoles snacks a bunch of food bro we only have a few days to do this oh and make the entire thing the Batcave with like some cool Batman entrance are we going to do all of that well we're figuring out how to build this epic room my editors were ready for their first surprise oh Lord we're going skydiving let's go there's no way I'm going skydiving no somebody's got to edit this video I have never been skydiving before this is truly first time what's the survival rate survival rates 100% So Far So Far So faring Jeremiah was having so much fun They even played rock paper scissors in the sky Rock Paper Scissors Shoot that was the best thing ever these floors are extremely old and gross in here so we're going to be adding a luxurious wooden floor across the entire room we're just getting started on this room and it already looks so much better each one of these boards is designed to fit just like a puzzle and this one goes right here perfect now that we have our flooring in it's time to add a Batman logo to make the surprise even better for my friends we're also going to be building a life-size transforming Batmobile we're about to build this Batmobile but massive we're going to build this Batmobile in five steps starting with the [Music] frame that's some good wood for a [Music] Batmobile this is step one of our Batmobile everything's getting stacked up from here now that we have our frame in place we can start adding all of the details to bring this to life this is looking really good but we need to add this piece right here it wouldn't be a car if we couldn't get inside of it so it's time to make the hole [Music] I feel like I'm Batman right now and I have two clowns the Joker's with me yeah I'm literally Batman so the shirt says so we're about to start attaching tons of foam blocks to the side of this car so we can start sculpting it to make it look just like spin Master's transforming Batmobile right now I'm adding all of the foam details to our transforming Batmobile ah you got fil on my camera much better next we're going to be covering this entire room with foam sheets so we can sculpt them to look like rocks we've covered this wall this wall and that wall with our foam finished now we can start sculpting it to make it look like rocks I love Bedrock Cobblestone deep slate you know all that kind of you're just naming things from video games possibly our goal is to add as much depth and dimension in this room as possible to make it look super realistic it's time to get glue in editors play a sick Montage sorry I just thought I had time to play while the foam is drying in this room I'm going to go work more on the transforming Batmobile right now we're getting ready to add the boosters on the back so the car can go super fast this is literally a perfect fit we still got to glue it though takes the glue about 2 hours to dry so I'm going to be here for a long time no I got you [Music] bro we have a massive problem this section is super rounded on the toy but on our real life version it's really square and boxy we're going to have to completely restart that and make it look more like this I'm going to start off by removing that now I'm going to remove the other side I I didn't loosen that one yet now we just need something that looks exactly like these cartoony [Music] curvs I was supposed to catch that but I'm not very good at catching let's install it perfect this is going to look so sick once we add the wheels I can't wait to surprise our editor Bennett with this because he loves cars he's going to freak out this is a little more of my speed this is so cool oh you're going down Jay whoever wins this race gets $1,000 that money is mine you're going down [Music] Bennett [Music] y I was so close told you win the transforming Batmobile has a ton of different details so we're going to use foam to sculpt all of them to actually bring ours to life one of the details is that the Batmobile has eight symbols all over it did you count the ones on the wheels uh no I forgot let's get started with the power of editing I'm going to reinvent the wheel one wheel down three more to go we're installing so many cool features on this car like secret doors oh there's my phone been looking for that for hours the next feature we're adding to the transfering bobile is this giant Blaster I'm sculpting with F this is supposed to look like a blaster it's it's getting there all right let's go work on the room the are currently extremely flat so we're going to use these Sanders to start making them look more realistic we're using my bicep as a model to get every crevice this looks so much more realistic once we paint this it's going to look exactly like a rock my favorite part of the cave we added this giant piece of dripstone going down into the depths of the cave right here did you know dripstone grows a centimeter per year this would have taken a long time to make a nature but we made it in 5 minutes this floor is extremely dirty making it really hard to work I got something up my sleev fix that wo bro it's so clean in here I can actually walk around I can lick the floors go ahead no there still does it's officially time to make this room look just like a cave we're going to start painting it believe it or not this isn't my first time painting rocks when's the other time you did it oh I already painted that wall a little bit that's right I can paint and film at the same time but I'm taking ladies what [Music] I feel like I'm actually inside of a cave right now this looks so good all this I'm Batman we look like Batman yet in this Batcave no is that supposed to be a superhero Landing you just jumped on the floor yeah I slipped now that I have all of the color laid out inside of the cave I'm going to be going around with this spray paint adding different colors so it pops this looks so dope I feel like all these small details are really starting to make the cave look real once we're finished with this car it's going to look incredible huge shout out to spin Master's transforming Batmobile for letting us do this this looks exactly like the toil no it does not what do you mean we we still got to paint it oh yeah well that's what we're going to do right this twoin one Batmobile and Command Center is truly Next Level the Batmobile transforms from a drivable tank to a full-blown Batcave Command Center just like the room we're building to make our life-size Batmobile just like the toy we have a bunch of details to add because it fires missiles has lights sounds and it's compatible with 4-in Figures it's time to transform our real Batmobile with this paint fun fact before I was a YouTuber I used to to paint cars and now I'm painting a car again life really comes full circle to paint this car as fast as possible we have the perfect teamwork bro I'm not looking and you're still hitting I'm sorry I'm trying not [Music] to since we want this to look exact I'm going to start replicating this paint job right here I got to make sure all these lines are symmetrical like my jawline I can't wait until we can actually test drive this car and do some crazy stuff with it Spin Master celebrating Batman's 85th Anniversary so it's the perfect toy for any B that actually looks so dope I got to be extra careful when I'm doing this make it look perfect oh jeez the transforming Batmobile features a zipline for Batman and a gel cell so if you're ready to get your hands on spin Master's brand new transforming Batmobile click the link in the description to get yours now it's available in all major retailers and it's super fun it's crazy to think that we're inside of our warehouse right now when I feel like I'm actually inside of Batman's cave and we still have a lot of things left to add we're going to put two different setups right here for them to play video games and edit on we're going to have a giant Batman logo right here that opens to a secret entrance don't tell anybody I guess a lot of people know now now that we have everything painted inside of our cave it looks truly incredible in here but we have a lot of details left to add and the next one is a custom door right here that slides open it's going to be sick now we just have to lift this door into place without breaking anything I don't think your foot's supposed to be under the door I'm a part of the door now and the coolest feature on this door is we actually managed to make it automatic our Batmobile is incredible but it's missing some of the details like the blast and the windshield so we're getting ready to add those today we have Matthew's credit card and we can get whatever we want dude look at that hey you know I think I'm going to need this monitor for my editing setup what do you think BR that's $7,000 Bennett so if I'm going to have the best editing office I'm going to need this I'm going to need this I'm going to need this I'm going to need this okay Jay all right all right I think we're good let's go the glass I bought for the Batmobile is super expensive so I made this windshield out of cheap wood to make sure I got all my cuts perfect it fits perfectly now it's time to make the real thing out of glass hopefully I don't mess this [Music] up now that I have all my pieces cut out I need to put a blue tint on them to match the Batmobile I feel like I'm inside of a fish tank well you're in the Batmobile now at the windshield's in place we have one thing left to add it's the giant Blaster that goes on the top Matthew I can't hear you we have one thing left to add and it's the giant we have one thing left to let's just add the blaster when we first started in this room there was a bunch of crazy wiring and batteries everywhere so we're about to install custom shelves to make everything much more organized in here it's so heavy ready 1 2 3 lift I can't Li my hands are you even lifting it I'm trying you didn't even move your side yet my toe's stuck we have the Shelf extremely close it just needs to go that way a little bit perfect now that we have the massive cabinet in place we're going to start adding all of the opening warws the stop motion edit makes this look a lot easier than it actually is yeah perfect like my jawline we have one shelf left to add but there's a massive problem looks like this dripstone might be in the way it looks like this cabinet's not going to be able to fit unless we cut a little bit of this rock I just hope we don't have to remove this part cuz it's one of my favorites it looks super cool bro this one of those rocks that has crystals inside let's just our [Music] foam so we have good news and bad news the Shelf open opens without hitting the foam but notice how I didn't say rock it's because that doesn't look like a rock anymore so we're going to have to fix that now we're getting ready to add a giant Batman logo right here that actually opens as a secret entrance leading to a TV we're going to start cutting out the rock right here so we can hide the TV inside then we'll put the Batman logo over it Mission success we want our editors to be able to play video games when they're in here and there wasn't a TV before so now there is in a second not right now I'm going to grab it perfect now we have a brand new TV inside of this room and the coolest part we're about to add a giant Batman logo over it so this is actually a secret hidden TV let's install it the coolest thing about this Batman logo is we put LEDs on the back side so when it's on the wall it glows uh you guys might need this oh yeah oh you almost dropped the Batman logo [Music] oh we're about to install all these different buttons and switches inside of our cave so it's just like Batman's Command Center the best part is each one of these will actually be functional oh Matthew that turns off the room that was actually just Noah hello obviously these don't work yet but soon we're going to be installing a fog machine LED lights and it'll all be controlled from these little buttons right here speaking of buttons spin Master's transforming Batmobile has this giant Blaster we need to go add it on our car we made this super complicated mechanism right here so the Blaster can point anywhere oh let's not point it that way this is the blaster on Spin Masters transform Batmobile and this one's ours let's see what it can do 3 2 1 I think it's safe to say our giant Blaster works very good my personal favorite feature about spin masters transfering Batmobile is all of the lights and sound effects inside of the command center so we're going to add those inside of our room as well I just got a text message our editors are going to be here any minute so we need to start cleaning it and adding all of the details so we can surprise them once we install this panel on the wall right here it's what controls everything inside of this room what does the big red button do don't touch that when I first went into this room they had a bunch of snacks so we're going to add some more I even got them a brand new PS5 did you just take that from Matthew's office Maybe it wouldn't be Batman's cave without Batman so we have this guy right here we officially added everything inside of this room now it's time for our light show Once I press this button everything in this room will turn on here we go bro this is insane oh my God I actually feel like I'm in Batman's cave right now our editor on the other side of the store I'm going to let them in and surprise them kind of nervous we worked extremely hard on this room you guys ready to see it yeah I'm very excited if you're enjoying the video so far subscribe all right check it out in 3 2 2 1 take a look W no way it feels like we're in a different world now dude look at that so cool and the pipes with the LED lights wow oh I love all of it man this is my favorite part Batcave there's a threat after surprising my friends with their new Incredible room it was time to show them the car it's like the toy my entire life I've always wanted to be a super herero and now that we have this life-size transforming Batmobile we're one step closer there's no way that Blaster works right all right Noah are you ready brother uh no 3 2 1 oh that was epic thanks so much for spas transor and bmobile for sponsoring this video make sure to get yours now and all major retailers bye [Music]"

scorpion riddle desert tombs stunning open areas to explore freely full of secrets for you to discover and you'll get more than just the Classic Whip and revolver Indy's journal and his camera will immerse you in the mystery providing extra info on all of your finds so you can appreciate all of the little historical details he obsesses over and those details are your key to solving the ancient

of fortnite's map is now covered in snow it has been a long time coming and now we can finally Kickstart Winterfest with a skimy toilet skin it begins in two days so here is our first look the second you jump from the battle bus you're going to see a massive ice block at the center of the island this has caught attention from everyone in the game right now because it's so tall the leakers have also revealed it'll be responsible for a mini live event this will introduce us to winfest so what's a giant ice block got to do with anything well what's exciting is about what lies inside actually it's about who lies inside over the next few days the block will defrost and start to crack open before finally revealing it's time B but joking Mariah Carey is hiding inside the ice block and she's about to break free and become a real fortnite skin not only is she hitting the item shop she has an edit Style with a special glow around her to truly recreate the Christmas spirit and yes I know what you're all wondering will she have and all I want for Christmas emote well the answer is pretty obvious you can't add Mariah Carey without it and that's why not only is the emote real and happening it's actually going to be for free once you defrost on the map and I can't believe I'm saying this you can talk to the Mariah Carey NPC and unlock the dance now she isn't even the craziest crossover of the day tonight the atam shop is going to update with the most controversial collab we've had in months I I'm literally dumbfounded as I'm commentating this video but skib toilet is coming to fortnite that's right when the shop rotates tonight you'll be able to pick up the plunger outfit which even has a Lego style along with the classic skibby toilet back bling obviously epic isn't allowed to use the iconic head because it belongs to valve so they went and designed an original version instead which still looks just as iconic though there's also a plunger man's plunger pickaxe and in total you can get all these in a bundle for 2200 v-bucks now this is causing a lot of division in the community one side thinks it's absolutely Ely hilarious and saying we finally have brain rod in fortnite the other half is pretty embarrassed about it I don't know what to think personally on one hand the Skins are well made and it's going to make a lot of people happy but I also know it's a very controversial topic either way the game is going to change forever because people will now be killing you with skibby toilet for years the Crossovers keep coming and this time it's actually on them on December 21st a new Batman Ninja skin is dropping which works perfectly with the season Samurai aesthetic and he'll also be joined by another Harley Quin outfit maybe she'll be Ninja theme too well it makes sense for Batman you know a martial artist to be running around as a samurai I'm not exactly sure Darth Vader takes that box and yet fortnite is also bringing back Vader for chapter 6 as a samurai now you might think it makes zero sense for Vader to have a ninja style but wait until you find out that Darth Vader was originally inspired by real life Samurai armor look at his helmet it's literally a black painted version of one Star Wars fans have been drawing fan art of Samurai Vader for years now and epic will make it happened literally this is the craziest update video I've ever made I'm just showing you all of these ridiculous crossovers coming in December and it continues with our next fortnite Festival artist so leakers revealed that new jeans it's most likely cancelled because they're currently going through a major breakup with the record label and probably won't be able to use their band name anymore instead we're getting a different singer except this one is virtual and they're actually being teased on the island right now head to seport city and you'll find a leak on the ground wrapped in pink and blue immediately fans of hats name Miku will know exactly what this is referencing one of miku's most viral moments is when fans made her dance to a song while holding leaks and it became iconic overnight well leakers have confirmed this will be her back bling and she's also coming with Festival instruments safe to say expect her in January right after this I'll tell you what Winterfest is giving away this year but I've got to tell you about the next icon series emote because it belongs to an iconic streamer sketch is getting his very own what's up brother emote in fact he even appeared in the reload trailer months ago doing this exact catch phrase what's up brother okay collab break time that's a lot what's happening in Winterfest 2024 for the last few years it's been kind of terrible not going to lie we haven't seen the 3D cabin in a long time and epic once turned the presence into a quest menu button like it it really did suck well they have learned their lesson I'm excited to report that the Winterfest cabin is back for chapter 6 on the couch you'll find two new Skins playing video games flaky the snowbird and we got Snoop Dog Snoop on the Snoop is here and he's going to be completely free his entire set is being gifted to us as a Winterfest present so is the U jacket Cosmetics which is a festive version of yellow jacket but Winterfest isn't just giving us two outfits There is five more coming to the item shop from snow opal and sleet skull to ice Holly Striker and snowy Ops what could be the fifth one well it's Santa sha we've known for a couple weeks now that Shaquille O'Neal is getting his own Christmas skin and now we get to see it in the flesh his metal has a Christmas tree on it and his grenades are w as pres I kind of love it we've also known that fortnite has been working on a new type of grenade for Winterfest and now we have new information about what exactly it'll do called the blizzard grenade when you throw it down it'll create a mini blizzard that blocks enemies from sprinting does damage and it slows them down so they can escape maybe you want something that'll make you faster though and don't worry skating is finally in fortnite just not the way we imagined we heard rumors that ice skates were coming to the game and got super excited only for leakers to reveal that they are just ice cubes you wear on your feet instead of a new skating mechanic it is just the Classic slippy feet we've had for years but hey at least we could toggle it on and off now it is going to make traversing those mountains way easier now you could just choose to drive a car down it instead and you're in luck because Winterfest is adding two new car bundles we have a Santa theme low rider for Snoop Dogg and a rubius decal for the Behemoth SUV we're also getting candy cane wheels and Christmas themed trails and boosts it wouldn't feel like Winterfest without Sergeant winter you will of course be returning to the map as an MPC so hopefully he'll be driving around and throwing presents like usual I'm not done revealing the insane crossovers for December there are still some pretty ridiculous things around the corner for example fortnite is about to add not just Godzilla but even Mecca Godzilla this is something that has been clickbaited and rumored for a long time and it's actually happening he's going to look insane as a skin but he's not the only futuristic character appearing in fortnite on December 23rd we're going to see cyberpunk 2077 official debut in the game Johnny silveran is getting his own outfit and there will be four entire tabs of Cosmetics including vcar and the Quadra Turbo R perhaps the craziest thing epic is adding back is the season shop who remembers it now leakers say it will not include the old items like Renegade Raider and aerial assault Trooper but you will need to earn up to 2 million XP before you can even purchase some of the items if you've been keeping up with the shop lately you'll know epic are bringing back a bunch of DC items all throughout December some last seen over 400 days ago we've already got Catwoman in the flash but now it's time for some you've all been waiting for Starfire and Harley Quinn are both updated to return soon along with Wonder Woman and the entire last laugh pack no sign of Batman just yet but with the samurai version on the way it can't be long before the old ones are turn to players who've been grinding non-stop the season could also start to claim their hard-earned rewards the battle fast super styles are now available letting you unlock the rhyme flow void burn and entropic variant for these five skins unfortunately two have to be left out meaning Baymax and nean didn't get any love this time some extra items will also be involved Ed over the next few weeks with Epicon break until the new year and the next update set for January 14th we have nearly a month of no more content but what does Epic have plan bunch of items are already in the files from the hunting rifle to the ranger AR even the chili chug splashes are set to make a return they're also inv vating ltms that's right epic have been updating both Throwdown a mode where every weapon is a grenade item and metal Mosh Pit which is basically a sword fight using only melee items this is the one we've heard leaks about for months and they don't seem 100 % finish just yet but with the power of UE FN fortnite could probably launch these at any moment they'll probably release for Winter Fest like last year's ship at Express and so will the New Year's Event every year it's pretty much the same thing just upgraded with newer graphics and effects each time so don't expect anything crazy when December 31st rolls around but it is good to know epic are still making it happen fans of the high stakes Club are getting an extra gift this year with a brand new let's hunt vampires Quest pack now there's a brand new member of the team Minato who's basically a male counterpart of Joanie the red you'll be able to pick him up in the shop soon along with his back bling pickaxe and Quest for, 1500 v-bucks maybe you prefer picking up a new car for Christmas and if it's not the cyberpunk Turbo R then save up for the Lamborghini Urus right finally going to get another SUV body in the game soon and it'll be arriving in the next few updates while you're driving around don't be surprised if you see the chat box pop up with random messages this update epic is completely broken the new game chat with messages displaying for everyone in the match I can't even imagine how this happened but I just know there's going to to be some Hilarious Moments until they patch this what isn't a mistake is adding so many new skins this update not only are there a bunch of encrypted collabs and Winterfest outfits but there's also a handful of other items added into from a new cat ninja Caspian to the Doberman this update is stack full of items to drain your v-bucks this holiday we're even getting dur Sushi straight out of the new restaurant along with a new Samurai ninja called ghoul there is also the return of golden archetype after he was added exactly one year ago and so many more like literally tons of skins even the other modes are getting in the Fest of spirit with Lego brick life getting a Christmas makeover and now the entire map is covered in snow for Winterfest decorating the streets and parks with candy canes trees snowman it's not all Funk op's Party building is also now open so you can head up the elevator explore the rooftop party very cool while you're exploring your snowy City a bunch of older skins have now just been upgraded to Lego form this update outfits like Midas rex have been updated to allow the last laugh pack to return even Patrick momes has been converted into a minifigure it's everything new in fortnite's final update of 2024 merry Christmas happy holidays to everybody it has been Tommy and keep it here top five gaming"

be up to 25% faster dude this is what I've been waiting for why are you waiting you could buy like a sick gaming rig right now for just a g yeah that's so last gen this is going to be worth the wait in other news tariffs on electronics that are manufactured outside of the United States so almost all of them are expected to result in major price hikes oh no what now what am I going to do should I build a computer now or should I wait for NextGen that's a great question viewer yes you and it's one we see all the time especially around big CPU or GPU launches and while the answer would normally be to plan a manageable budget for yourself and upgrade whenever your current system is no longer meeting your needs with those potential tariffs inbound things could get a little more complicated especially for our American friends but there is some good news because believe it or not this isn't the first time that we run into this type of consumer taxation so we only need to look at the recent past to understand how tariffs could impact our purchases be they on PC parts washing machines or even merch on LTT store I hope things don't go down this path I want a 50 Series GPU but if

games War Thunder is super comprehensive easy to get into and available on PC consoles and mobile devices play for free using the link in the video description reason number one to pull the trigger now is you know what you're getting as cliche as it sounds until there are third party reviews we don't really know what's coming down the pipe sometimes the pre-launch rumors end up being pretty accurate but other times they aren't and it can be a pretty poopy feeling to wait sometimes months for a pot at the end of the rainbow that turns out to be Fool's Gold number two it's Q4 baby T the season for inventory management and as we outlined in our holiday buyer guide you can pick up a machine that will handle any AAA game out there for less than you'd probably think and in our recent review of the AMD ryzen 9800 X 3D we found that even an older am4 and ddr4 system is still very capable of modern gaming and can save you a ton of money money that can be spent on a better GPU for enhanced visuals and guys I know what you're going to say buying an older CPU platform can limit your future upgrades but look at this we asked our staff here what parts they usually upgrade before they just give in and get a whole new platform and while 40% said GPU the cold hard truth is that most people don't won't upgrade their CPUs which leads us to reason number three how often do you really need to upgrade your PC even our team of very techy gamery folks seems to be on about a 2 to threee cycle just enough time to buy now and hopefully wait out the future tariff storm ah yes the dreaded t-word to find out more about tariffs and how they might impact pricing I asked Elijah who wrote this video to ask Taran who has a friend who worked in the PC hardware supply chain last time a US Administration peaked at uh Brazil's homework and thought hm that seems like a good idea he explained it to me by laying out two different scenarios imagine I'm Walmart I'm buying a 590 at a bulk price of $100 and I'm going to sell them for $125 I make a tidy profit and you get your GPU that's scenario one without any tariffs now for scenario 2 let's say a flat 50% tariff is applied to a country where I purchased the GPU from I reach out to order some more and there's a extra little line on my invoice 50% of the value of what my order was now I couldn't sell it for 125 even if I wanted to I'd be losing money so to keep my profit I need to sell them for $175 but now my shareholders are upset because they see my gross margins shrink from 25% to 177% okay let's go with 18750 that looks terrible on a price tag $189.99 now last time around the electronics tariffs were mostly targeting goods manufactured in China which then resulted in manufacturers investing in factories outside of China so that they could avoid them but there's a little hidden cost to the consumers there as well let's say I'm foxcon now different hat I drop a quarter of a bill to build a new Factory in Vietnam there's no Chinese tariffs there but someone still has to foot the bill I know I'll just charge $125 for that GPU now it's less than a150 so I'm still competitive in the market and in no time at all consumers will get used to paying more for the same product more gravy for me baby obviously that's an oversimplification but there also are examples of times when it's played out just like this the prear RTX 3080 for instance launched for $700 and had a die area so the size of the actual silicon chip of 628 mm the post tariff RTX 480 launched for $200 and has a die area of just 379 mm now some of this price increase can be traced back to external factors like higher wafer costs for more advanced manufacturing process nodes not to mention the global inflation that is taken place over the last half a decade but a big part of it is just plain charging More For Less now that they've figured out consumers are willing to pay and this time around it could be worse because so many companies Diversified their manufacturing out of China last time around there's a lot of Talk Amongst American policy makers about implementing import tariffs rather than just limiting the tariffs to the exports of a particular country that will result in manufacturers billing out for both their Investments that they've made to diversify their manufacturing and the tariffs that are being surrendered to the US government and it's not like the retailer is going to get caught holding the bag they're just going to mark up accordingly and if sales volumes decline they'll simply order less so now the GPU from our example that used to cost $125 at the till is $235 and guess who paid for it you on Monday November 25th president-elect Trump announced a 25% tariff on all Goods coming from Canada as well we'll have to see if they actually follow through with that but based on that announcement our red white and blue friends are going to want to order your LT merch right now need a new screwdriver want to level up your cable management well now is the perfect time to grab great deals during cyber weekend on LT store shop all of our Black Friday and Cyber Monday specials at lmg gblack Friday now look I'm not even going to bother reading comments on this video because I'm sure that some folks are going to accuse me of getting political but math is not political math is math and as heartless as it sounds the math says that our standard of living in the western world is enabled by unfettered access to cheap overseas labor and if you think that moving manufacturing back is going to solve inflation or even happen at all I have some hard truths for you one is that Americans don't want a lot of these jobs tsmc for example has had a heck of a Time hiring for their Arizona semiconductor Fab and for some pretty good reasons one of the most obvious ones is the misaligned expectations of work life balance Now American workers rights are far from perfect but what they are is world's better than what you might find elsewhere around the globe Americans rightly expect things like limited shift times mandated vacations the right to collective bargaining etc etc another less obvious reason is the eroded pipeline of qualified applicant it takes decades to resolve the chicken egg dilemma and develop the steady stream of both new talent and new jobs that makes an entire industry tick it's one of the reasons that our Labs team has struggled so much to hire subject matter experts like if we were in South Korea for instance and we wanted to hire a display expert we would be tripping over applicants here not so much and it isn't just us ratings for instance has had a job posting up for a display person for ages hard truth number two Americans don't generally want to pay for americanmade products there are exceptions many many exceptions All-American clothing even has this handy dandy list of companies who make their products in America many of which are crushing it I'm personally partial to my onshore manufactured Darn Tough socks from Vermont but that doesn't change that the overwhelming trend is toward Bargain Basement overseas marketplaces with tenu surpassing shopping apps from giants like Amazon and Walmart earlier this year and more and more I see an attitude of if it costs a few dollars more it's a complete scam a sentiment that actually makes a ton of sense given the ongoing economic challenges that have ballooned our cost of living since realistically the 1980s hard truth number three maybe the hardest one of all is that even if Americans wanted these jobs and were willing to pay a premium for goods that were manufactured by their friends and neighbors they don't have enough neighbors us unemployment is sitting at about 4% it's not exactly a historic low and has been creeping up but it is well below the last sustained high that we saw during the 2008 financial crisis and it's not that far above the deepest historic lows of about 2.5% so I don't know maybe there's a scenario where folks want to make career moves into manufacturing roles but what I suspect is that most don't ask yourself would I rather do this all day don't forget it's for minimum wage or less so that's the math there is a political conversation to be had here something around the Deep societal change that would need to take place in order to significantly alter the math but that that's not something I'm going to touch on so let's come back to should you buy a PC right now well based on the rhetoric we're seeing so far might not be a bad idea the RTX 590 was already rumored to hit the market at around 2,000 Freedom bucks if the proposed tariffs go through that could jump to more like 2500 for parts that are manufactured outside of China and maybe even more for anything that's manufactured within China now Nvidia May absorb some of this in their margins you know as a favor to Gamers but they also might not and you could build a pretty nice I don't know entire gaming machine for that much money right now another X Factor is do you guys remember the last time I made a video called buy a PC right now that was right on the eve of a crypto boom that drove GPU prices into the stratosphere for years well guess what's booming again right now look if you don't have the money at the moment or you want to hold out for NextGen don't worry too much this all might end up being a nothing Burger but if you were waiting for the right moment to strike electronics are pretty affordable out there right now and I expect that game developers are going to be targeting current hardware for quite a few years while we wait for a new generation of consoles so that 5090 probably won't be needed for a while you know what we will need

round in my life at the beginning of this game there were 50 YouTubers and now there remains 10 this will be the final challenge what I made it to the final challenge so what we're going to do is we're going to start over here with poke you poke will have 60 seconds to explain how you're going to give this money away and we're going to go down the line and hear everyone's explanation person with the most votes will win oh crap okay all right your 60 seconds has begun now how would you give this 100 Grand away to your subscribers I would definitely do crazy challenges go live somewhere in the world and give whoever finds me first $100,000 I would probably just make like a giant Roblox game and do like a big video do something where 100 subscribers could get $1,000 we are looking to give people a chance to play Roblox give those people a chance to have PCS better phones I will be creating a Roblox game and all the proceeds will go to charity I want to do like a huge competition with my subscribers I would give the 100K out to the Roblox meme Community make a Minecraft server with a 1,000 player limit and whoever logs off last gets all the money this video made me love the Roblox creators and the community so I decided to do the following I would give the 100K to two of the subscribers of all the YouTubers that competed in this challenge wao you're a smart man well here I'm going to use your nine remaining seconds to say if you ever need to start an online web s ite use do store domain the $100,000 you're given away in this video is coming from dot store they're amazing time is up all right the person with the least amount of votes the suspense is killing me was Wally bear what Wall-E it's cuz I play Minecraft isn't it second the last place is pokey no the next elimination is night box oh L Deon boot uh-huh Big B yikes tell us what the oxygen is like up there in the atmosphere cuz we're about to launch you oh oh you guys are now in the top three no way

Tariq we did it why do you guys do this to me now they're going to think I ranked it for my friends when you guys are the ones who voted for them yo what's up guys I decided to donate the 50,000 to comic relief this charity right here they made a game in Roblox called kids relief simulator so check them out support support the game"

the essential phone is powered by a snapdragon 835 and backed by 4GB of ram so it can handle most Android games plus it's still a great CPU for emulation.

what's going on everybody it's eta prime back here again today we're going to be turning this inexpensive used android device into a gaming console well at least we're going to try to do that what i have here is the essential phone ph1 i picked this up on ebay for 67 ship it was in b grade there is a little bit of a scratch on the screen i don't know if you can see it on camera it's not in the best shape but the device itself functions perfectly fine and when it comes down to it there was three main reasons i chose this device first the price second cpu it's using the snapdragon 835 it's getting a bit dated but it still performs pretty decently and finally one of the most important parts to turning this into a console the essential phone ph1 does support hdmi over usb type-c i didn't want to do any casting or anything like that we can get a direct feed out of usb type-c to a bigger screen a monitor or a tv and not all devices support hdmi over usb type-c that's one of the main things i look for in my android devices nowadays especially when i'm getting a new flagship samsung supports it with their galaxy s line from the s8 on up and if i was willing to spend a little more money on this project i probably would have went with like the s9 or an s10e but they are much more expensive used on ebay than this essential phone ph1 was so we've established that this phone does support hdmi over usb type c really the next thing you're going to need is an hdmi to usb type-c adapter there are several on the market b-link just released their expand x which is a nice little stand with usb type-c full-size usb and it's a good little unit but it comes in around 35 to 40 dollars this one here was around 20 bucks on amazon it does have an sd card slot ethernet usb 3.0 and obviously hdmi out but one of my favorite devices to use is this one here and i'm not sure of the brand but i will leave a link in the description it's a simple usb type c to hdmi adapter with usb 3 usb 2 and another usb type c in for charging your device while everything's plugged in this was the cheapest of the bunch and it does work really well with all the devices that i've tested another thing i would recommend is a little stand this is a cheap foldable stand that i picked up from my local dollar store for a buck and i bought a bunch of them because i know i'm going to lose some and break some but it works great with this device and it'll just keep everything up off of your table all right so let's go ahead and get everything connected since i have some full-size usb ports on this usb type-c to hdmi adapter i'm going to plug in a keyboard i also have a bluetooth controller connected to the phone so i can play my favorite emulators and games so i've just got the hdmi plugged into this adapter i'm also going to add power that way my phone charges while it's all plugged in it will work without it charging though so we've got this set up and i mean you can put this basically any way you want you don't need a stand you could actually just set this on your desk if you want to we've got hdmi plugged in and here it is we're now basically mirroring the phone over hdmi and as you can see this is in portrait mode and unfortunately with android 10 we cannot rotate the main screen unless you use a third-party app so i actually like to use an application from the google play store called tv launcher it's fully customizable there's a free version and there's a pro version but it looks something like this and it definitely makes that main menu much more usable on a bigger screen as you can see here you can use a mouse and keyboard to navigate this interface or you can go ahead and navigate the whole operating system with something like an xbox one controller connected over bluetooth now personally this is the way i like to have mine set up but with android 10 we have a desktop mode unfortunately it is a bit finicky with different applications but it's actually really easy to get up and running and it does work on the essential phone ph1 so you have to enable developer options and from here we can set up force desktop mode after you enable it the first time you will have to reboot your device but once you have it enabled and then you plug your android device into the hdmi adapter it gives us kind of a desktop interface now i think it looks pretty good it fills the full screen but unfortunately there are some apps that just don't work well with desktop mode and minecraft is one of them it will not go full screen i've run into a few other ones but if you find that most of the apps you want to use work well with desktop mode you can always use it just like this a lot of the emulators work just fine if i go ahead and start up let's say redream you can see that it goes full screen on me and i'll have no issues at all emulating my favorite dreamcast games in desktop mode so this is definitely another option for you if you don't want to use the tv launcher but i prefer using the tv launcher that way i don't run into any kind of compatibility issues with my favorite apps i'm using my xbox one controller right now let's go ahead and start up call of duty mobile i just jumped right into some gameplay here and if you do end up using a controller with this game here make sure you go in and change the sensitivity it's a bit low for me the way it's sitting right out of the box but i mean it is playable and i could get used to it minecraft is another one that works really well with controllers and is fully playable on a system like this but one of my main use case scenarios for picking up an old used phone like this and hooking it up over hdmi is emulation on the big screen here we have some dreamcast emulation using the redream emulator we have doa2 i'm running the set 16x9 and upscale to 1280x960 it plays just fine on the snapdragon 835 next up we have some psp using the standalone version of ppsspp this is ratchet and clank i'm upscaled to 3x using the vulcan back in here and as you can see we're running at full speed now this game originally ran at 30fps so that's what we have here with this one when it comes to higher end emulation like gamecube and wii there are some games that the snapdragon 835 can run but don't expect to run all of these gamecube games at full speed like i mentioned at the beginning of this video the 835 is getting a bit dated but it still holds its own i mean it's still a good chip [Music] as we know there's still a lot of android games on google play that don't officially support controllers just yet like ginge and impact hopefully they do add official support in the future but there are ways around this using third-party apps from google play that allow you to kind of map the controller as a touch button the one i'm using here is called mantis pro and it does work well with the xbox one controller so obviously putting something like this together isn't for everybody and if it was up to me i would probably use the samsung galaxy s9 up to the s11 but uh as a secondary phone for something cheap these essential phone ph-1s have that snapdragon 835 they support hdmi over usb type-c and they can be picked up relatively cheap now the only downside to getting something like the ph one here is they're not going to receive any more updates well at least any more official updates but there are third party roms for this phone out there i'm not sure if they still support hdmi over usb type c so you really need to do your research but the way it sits right now we're on android 10 and personally i do think this makes an awesome little emulation set up but that's going to wrap it up for this one really appreciate you watching if you're interested in putting something like this together i will leave some links in the description but keep in mind if you already have a samsung galaxy s series from the s8 on up it already supports hdmi over usb type-c and we have something that this phone doesn't and that's samsung dex which i'm a huge fan of if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always thanks for watching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcWh6FAMUa8,1440p OLED or 4K Monitor for Gaming?,,Zach's Tech Turf,,Gaming,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture",2024-09-29T22:56:04Z,0:01:00,986116,1549,,True,should I get a 4K gaming monitor or a 1440p OLED for an RTX 480 super great question there's an easy answer and a more difficult answer the easy answer comes from deciding if you value more resolution or FPS for AAA single player games where you can actually stop and enjoy the graphics you might appreciate 4K a bit more whereas if you play mostly competitive titles where a higher FPS actually helps you the 1440p OLED may be a better pick but more importantly than that especially with the 480 super and my opinion which one of those options is going to give you the biggest impact on your overall gaming experience in my own opinion completely subjective I don't think that 4K is all that special compared to 1440p there is a huge jump going from 1080p to 1440p but I think that Gap is much smaller going to 4K however the difference from a nonb monitor to an olb monitor is huge personally I would go with the 1440p OLED in this situation because it's just a bigger wow factor compared to more pixels

of fortnite's map is now covered in snow it has been a long time coming and now we can finally Kickstart Winterfest with a skimy toilet skin it begins in two days so here is our first look the second you jump from the battle bus you're going to see a massive ice block at the center of the island this has caught attention from everyone in the game right now because it's so tall the leakers have also revealed it'll be responsible for a mini live event this will introduce us to winfest so what's a giant ice block got to do with anything well what's exciting is about what lies inside actually it's about who lies inside over the next few days the block will defrost and start to crack open before finally revealing it's time B but joking Mariah Carey is hiding inside the ice block and she's about to break free and become a real fortnite skin not only is she hitting the item shop she has an edit Style with a special glow around her to truly recreate the Christmas spirit and yes I know what you're all wondering will she have and all I want for Christmas emote well the answer is pretty obvious you can't add Mariah Carey without it and that's why not only is the emote real and happening it's actually going to be for free once you defrost on the map and I can't believe I'm saying this you can talk to the Mariah Carey NPC and unlock the dance now she isn't even the craziest crossover of the day tonight the atam shop is going to update with the most controversial collab we've had in months I I'm literally dumbfounded as I'm commentating this video but skib toilet is coming to fortnite that's right when the shop rotates tonight you'll be able to pick up the plunger outfit which even has a Lego style along with the classic skibby toilet back bling obviously epic isn't allowed to use the iconic head because it belongs to valve so they went and designed an original version instead which still looks just as iconic though there's also a plunger man's plunger pickaxe and in total you can get all these in a bundle for 2200 v-bucks now this is causing a lot of division in the community one side thinks it's absolutely Ely hilarious and saying we finally have brain rod in fortnite the other half is pretty embarrassed about it I don't know what to think personally on one hand the Skins are well made and it's going to make a lot of people happy but I also know it's a very controversial topic either way the game is going to change forever because people will now be killing you with skibby toilet for years the Crossovers keep coming and this time it's actually on them on December 21st a new Batman Ninja skin is dropping which works perfectly with the season Samurai aesthetic and he'll also be joined by another Harley Quin outfit maybe she'll be Ninja theme too well it makes sense for Batman you know a martial artist to be running around as a samurai I'm not exactly sure Darth Vader takes that box and yet fortnite is also bringing back Vader for chapter 6 as a samurai now you might think it makes zero sense for Vader to have a ninja style but wait until you find out that Darth Vader was originally inspired by real life Samurai armor look at his helmet it's literally a black painted version of one Star Wars fans have been drawing fan art of Samurai Vader for years now and epic will make it happened literally this is the craziest update video I've ever made I'm just showing you all of these ridiculous crossovers coming in December and it continues with our next fortnite Festival artist so leakers revealed that new jeans it's most likely cancelled because they're currently going through a major breakup with the record label and probably won't be able to use their band name anymore instead we're getting a different singer except this one is virtual and they're actually being teased on the island right now head to seport city and you'll find a leak on the ground wrapped in pink and blue immediately fans of hats name Miku will know exactly what this is referencing one of miku's most viral moments is when fans made her dance to a song while holding leaks and it became iconic overnight well leakers have confirmed this will be her back bling and she's also coming with Festival instruments safe to say expect her in January right after this I'll tell you what Winterfest is giving away this year but I've got to tell you about the next icon series emote because it belongs to an iconic streamer sketch is getting his very own what's up brother emote in fact he even appeared in the reload trailer months ago doing this exact catch phrase what's up brother okay collab break time that's a lot what's happening in Winterfest 2024 for the last few years it's been kind of terrible not going to lie we haven't seen the 3D cabin in a long time and epic once turned the presence into a quest menu button like it it really did suck well they have learned their lesson I'm excited to report that the Winterfest cabin is back for chapter 6 on the couch you'll find two new Skins playing video games flaky the snowbird and we got Snoop Dog Snoop on the Snoop is here and he's going to be completely free his entire set is being gifted to us as a Winterfest present so is the U jacket Cosmetics which is a festive version of yellow jacket but Winterfest isn't just giving us two outfits There is five more coming to the item shop from snow opal and sleet skull to ice Holly Striker and snowy Ops what could be the fifth one well it's Santa sha we've known for a couple weeks now that Shaquille O'Neal is getting his own Christmas skin and now we get to see it in the flesh his metal has a Christmas tree on it and his grenades are w as pres I kind of love it we've also known that fortnite has been working on a new type of grenade for Winterfest and now we have new information about what exactly it'll do called the blizzard grenade when you throw it down it'll create a mini blizzard that blocks enemies from sprinting does damage and it slows them down so they can escape maybe you want something that'll make you faster though and don't worry skating is finally in fortnite just not the way we imagined we heard rumors that ice skates were coming to the game and got super excited only for leakers to reveal that they are just ice cubes you wear on your feet instead of a new skating mechanic it is just the Classic slippy feet we've had for years but hey at least we could toggle it on and off now it is going to make traversing those mountains way easier now you could just choose to drive a car down it instead and you're in luck because Winterfest is adding two new car bundles we have a Santa theme low rider for Snoop Dogg and a rubius decal for the Behemoth SUV we're also getting candy cane wheels and Christmas themed trails and boosts it wouldn't feel like Winterfest without Sergeant winter you will of course be returning to the map as an MPC so hopefully he'll be driving around and throwing presents like usual I'm not done revealing the insane crossovers for December there are still some pretty ridiculous things around the corner for example fortnite is about to add not just Godzilla but even Mecca Godzilla this is something that has been clickbaited and rumored for a long time and it's actually happening he's going to look insane as a skin but he's not the only futuristic character appearing in fortnite on December 23rd we're going to see cyberpunk 2077 official debut in the game Johnny silveran is getting his own outfit and there will be four entire tabs of Cosmetics including vcar and the Quadra Turbo R perhaps the craziest thing epic is adding back is the season shop who remembers it now leakers say it will not include the old items like Renegade Raider and aerial assault Trooper but you will need to earn up to 2 million XP before you can even purchase some of the items if you've been keeping up with the shop lately you'll know epic are bringing back a bunch of DC items all throughout December some last seen over 400 days ago we've already got Catwoman in the flash but now it's time for some you've all been waiting for Starfire and Harley Quinn are both updated to return soon along with Wonder Woman and the entire last laugh pack no sign of Batman just yet but with the samurai version on the way it can't be long before the old ones are turn to players who've been grinding non-stop the season could also start to claim their hard-earned rewards the battle fast super styles are now available letting you unlock the rhyme flow void burn and entropic variant for these five skins unfortunately two have to be left out meaning Baymax and nean didn't get any love this time some extra items will also be involved Ed over the next few weeks with Epicon break until the new year and the next update set for January 14th we have nearly a month of no more content but what does Epic have plan bunch of items are already in the files from the hunting rifle to the ranger AR even the chili chug splashes are set to make a return they're also inv vating ltms that's right epic have been updating both Throwdown a mode where every weapon is a grenade item and metal Mosh Pit which is basically a sword fight using only melee items this is the one we've heard leaks about for months and they don't seem 100 % finish just yet but with the power of UE FN fortnite could probably launch these at any moment they'll probably release for Winter Fest like last year's ship at Express and so will the New Year's Event every year it's pretty much the same thing just upgraded with newer graphics and effects each time so don't expect anything crazy when December 31st rolls around but it is good to know epic are still making it happen fans of the high stakes Club are getting an extra gift this year with a brand new let's hunt vampires Quest pack now there's a brand new member of the team Minato who's basically a male counterpart of Joanie the red you'll be able to pick him up in the shop soon along with his back bling pickaxe and Quest for, 1500 v-bucks maybe you prefer picking up a new car for Christmas and if it's not the cyberpunk Turbo R then save up for the Lamborghini Urus right finally going to get another SUV body in the game soon and it'll be arriving in the next few updates while you're driving around don't be surprised if you see the chat box pop up with random messages this update epic is completely broken the new game chat with messages displaying for everyone in the match I can't even imagine how this happened but I just know there's going to to be some Hilarious Moments until they patch this what isn't a mistake is adding so many new skins this update not only are there a bunch of encrypted collabs and Winterfest outfits but there's also a handful of other items added into from a new cat ninja Caspian to the Doberman this update is stack full of items to drain your v-bucks this holiday we're even getting dur Sushi straight out of the new restaurant along with a new Samurai ninja called ghoul there is also the return of golden archetype after he was added exactly one year ago and so many more like literally tons of skins even the other modes are getting in the Fest of spirit with Lego brick life getting a Christmas makeover and now the entire map is covered in snow for Winterfest decorating the streets and parks with candy canes trees snowman it's not all Funk op's Party building is also now open so you can head up the elevator explore the rooftop party very cool while you're exploring your snowy City a bunch of older skins have now just been upgraded to Lego form this update outfits like Midas rex have been updated to allow the last laugh pack to return even Patrick momes has been converted into a minifigure it's everything new in fortnite's final update of 2024 merry Christmas happy holidays to everybody it has been Tommy and keep it here top five gaming"

be up to 25% faster dude this is what I've been waiting for why are you waiting you could buy like a sick gaming rig right now for just a g yeah that's so last gen this is going to be worth the wait in other news tariffs on electronics that are manufactured outside of the United States so almost all of them are expected to result in major price hikes oh no what now what am I going to do should I build a computer now or should I wait for NextGen that's a great question viewer yes you and it's one we see all the time especially around big CPU or GPU launches and while the answer would normally be to plan a manageable budget for yourself and upgrade whenever your current system is no longer meeting your needs with those potential tariffs inbound things could get a little more complicated especially for our American friends but there is some good news because believe it or not this isn't the first time that we run into this type of consumer taxation so we only need to look at the recent past to understand how tariffs could impact our purchases be they on PC parts washing machines or even merch on LTT store I hope things don't go down this path I want a 50 Series GPU but if this new tax comes into effect now could be a really Savvy time to buy a PC rather than waiting let's break it down and break down this segue to our sponsor War Thunder if you're into vehicle combat games War Thunder is super comprehensive easy to get into and available on PC consoles and mobile devices play for free using the link in the video description reason number one to pull the trigger now is you know what you're getting as cliche as it sounds until there are third party reviews we don't really know what's coming down the pipe sometimes the pre-launch rumors end up being pretty accurate but other times they aren't and it can be a pretty poopy feeling to wait sometimes months for a pot at the end of the rainbow that turns out to be Fool's Gold number two it's Q4 baby T the season for inventory management and as we outlined in our holiday buyer guide you can pick up a machine that will handle any AAA game out there for less than you'd probably think and in our recent review of the AMD ryzen 9800 X 3D we found that even an older am4 and ddr4 system is still very capable of modern gaming and can save you a ton of money money that can be spent on a better GPU for enhanced visuals and guys I know what you're going to say buying an older CPU platform can limit your future upgrades but look at this we asked our staff here what parts they usually upgrade before they just give in and get a whole new platform and while 40% said GPU the cold hard truth is that most people don't won't upgrade their CPUs which leads us to reason number three how often do you really need to upgrade your PC even our team of very techy gamery folks seems to be on about a 2 to threee cycle just enough time to buy now and hopefully wait out the future tariff storm ah yes the dreaded t-word to find out more about tariffs and how they might impact pricing I asked Elijah who wrote this video to ask Taran who has a friend who worked in the PC hardware supply chain last time a US Administration peaked at uh Brazil's homework and thought hm that seems like a good idea he explained it to me by laying out two different scenarios imagine I'm Walmart I'm buying a 590 at a bulk price of $100 and I'm going to sell them for $125 I make a tidy profit and you get your GPU that's scenario one without any tariffs now for scenario 2 let's say a flat 50% tariff is applied to a country where I purchased the GPU from I reach out to order some more and there's a extra little line on my invoice 50% of the value of what my order was now I couldn't sell it for 125 even if I wanted to I'd be losing money so to keep my profit I need to sell them for $175 but now my shareholders are upset because they see my gross margins shrink from 25% to 177% okay let's go with 18750 that looks terrible on a price tag $189.99 now last time around the electronics tariffs were mostly targeting goods manufactured in China which then resulted in manufacturers investing in factories outside of China so that they could avoid them but there's a little hidden cost to the consumers there as well let's say I'm foxcon now different hat I drop a quarter of a bill to build a new Factory in Vietnam there's no Chinese tariffs there but someone still has to foot the bill I know I'll just charge $125 for that GPU now it's less than a150 so I'm still competitive in the market and in no time at all consumers will get used to paying more for the same product more gravy for me baby obviously that's an oversimplification but there also are examples of times when it's played out just like this the prear RTX 3080 for instance launched for $700 and had a die area so the size of the actual silicon chip of 628 mm the post tariff RTX 480 launched for $200 and has a die area of just 379 mm now some of this price increase can be traced back to external factors like higher wafer costs for more advanced manufacturing process nodes not to mention the global inflation that is taken place over the last half a decade but a big part of it is just plain charging More For Less now that they've figured out consumers are willing to pay and this time around it could be worse because so many companies Diversified their manufacturing out of China last time around there's a lot of Talk Amongst American policy makers about implementing import tariffs rather than just limiting the tariffs to the exports of a particular country that will result in manufacturers billing out for both their Investments that they've made to diversify their manufacturing and the tariffs that are being surrendered to the US government and it's not like the retailer is going to get caught holding the bag they're just going to mark up accordingly and if sales volumes decline they'll simply order less so now the GPU from our example that used to cost $125 at the till is $235 and guess who paid for it you on Monday November 25th president-elect Trump announced a 25% tariff on all Goods coming from Canada as well we'll have to see if they actually follow through with that but based on that announcement our red white and blue friends are going to want to order your LT merch right now need a new screwdriver want to level up your cable management well now is the perfect time to grab great deals during cyber weekend on LT store shop all of our Black Friday and Cyber Monday specials at lmg gblack Friday now look I'm not even going to bother reading comments on this video because I'm sure that some folks are going to accuse me of getting political but math is not political math is math and as heartless as it sounds the math says that our standard of living in the western world is enabled by unfettered access to cheap overseas labor and if you think that moving manufacturing back is going to solve inflation or even happen at all I have some hard truths for you one is that Americans don't want a lot of these jobs tsmc for example has had a heck of a Time hiring for their Arizona semiconductor Fab and for some pretty good reasons one of the most obvious ones is the misaligned expectations of work life balance Now American workers rights are far from perfect but what they are is world's better than what you might find elsewhere around the globe Americans rightly expect things like limited shift times mandated vacations the right to collective bargaining etc etc another less obvious reason is the eroded pipeline of qualified applicant it takes decades to resolve the chicken egg dilemma and develop the steady stream of both new talent and new jobs that makes an entire industry tick it's one of the reasons that our Labs team has struggled so much to hire subject matter experts like if we were in South Korea for instance and we wanted to hire a display expert we would be tripping over applicants here not so much and it isn't just us ratings for instance has had a job posting up for a display person for ages hard truth number two Americans don't generally want to pay for americanmade products there are exceptions many many exceptions All-American clothing even has this handy dandy list of companies who make their products in America many of which are crushing it I'm personally partial to my onshore manufactured Darn Tough socks from Vermont but that doesn't change that the overwhelming trend is toward Bargain Basement overseas marketplaces with tenu surpassing shopping apps from giants like Amazon and Walmart earlier this year and more and more I see an attitude of if it costs a few dollars more it's a complete scam a sentiment that actually makes a ton of sense given the ongoing economic challenges that have ballooned our cost of living since realistically the 1980s hard truth number three maybe the hardest one of all is that even if Americans wanted these jobs and were willing to pay a premium for goods that were manufactured by their friends and neighbors they don't have enough neighbors us unemployment is sitting at about 4% it's not exactly a historic low and has been creeping up but it is well below the last sustained high that we saw during the 2008 financial crisis and it's not that far above the deepest historic lows of about 2.5% so I don't know maybe there's a scenario where folks want to make career moves into manufacturing roles but what I suspect is that most don't ask yourself would I rather do this all day don't forget it's for minimum wage or less so that's the math there is a political conversation to be had here something around the Deep societal change that would need to take place in order to significantly alter the math but that that's not something I'm going to touch on so let's come back to should you buy a PC right now well based on the rhetoric we're seeing so far might not be a bad idea the RTX 590 was already rumored to hit the market at around 2,000 Freedom bucks if the proposed tariffs go through that could jump to more like 2500 for parts that are manufactured outside of China and maybe even more for anything that's manufactured within China now Nvidia May absorb some of this in their margins you know as a favor to Gamers but they also might not and you could build a pretty nice I don't know entire gaming machine for that much money right now another X Factor is do you guys remember the last time I made a video called buy a PC right now that was right on the eve of a crypto boom that drove GPU prices into the stratosphere for years well guess what's booming again right now look if you don't have the money at the moment or you want to hold out for NextGen don't worry too much this all might end up being a nothing Burger but if you were waiting for the right moment to strike electronics are pretty affordable out there right now and I expect that game developers are going to be targeting current hardware for quite a few years while we wait for a new generation of consoles so that 5090 probably won't be needed for a while you know what we will need though is this segue to our sponsor War Thunder take to the skies strike from the sea and dominate on land with War Thunder thousands of vehicles each modeled accurately from their real life

out, you get charged a premium, and games ain't cheap. They never really have been, but now with all of the
nickel-and-diming, it's much worse. But also, it doesn't last too long. After a period of time, you start seeing those deep discounts. Whether on one of the
console stores or on Steam, the prices get better. Hi, folks, it's Falcon,
and today on Gameranx, the 20 best recent games
that are now dirt cheap. Starting off at number 20, it's ""Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy"". For anyone looking for cheap
games, one of the best places to start is with AAA single-player
games that underperform. These things always end up selling for pretty deep discounts
fairly regularly, and ""Guardians"" was no exception. Most online stores sell it for $60 retail, but it's sometimes on sale, where it drops to around $15 usually, and it's been known to go as low as $10. That's an 83% discount. The game's cheap, and it may
not have sold the millions of copies Square Enix wanted, but it's one of the best
Marvel games to date. Still looks fantastic,
got a great soundtrack, and the story's actually
surprisingly engaging, and it's thankfully not nearly as cringey as the pre-release trailers made it look. For 10 bucks, it's a steal. At number 19 is ""Ghostrunner 2."" It's ""Ghostrunner,"" but more,
and that's all right with me. It does throw in the motorcycle, which is a fantastic addition. It's also still practically new, but you can already get it
on sale for around $9.99 on multiple online stores. It's a noteworthy discount by itself, I mean, the game usually
goes for 40 bucks, but the all time low is a shocker. Last year, you could get
this game on Voidu for $1.29. That's crazy cheap for a game
that is as good as this one. At the end of the day, it's
more ""Ghostrunner,"" like I said. They made a few changes to make the game a
little less frustrating, there's more variety, the
motorcycle parts are real cool, the boss fights are better. Not a total upgrade from the
first game, but cool additions, and for 10 bucks, more
""Ghostrunner"" is a solid deal. At number 18 is ""Ghostwire: Tokyo,"" another game that didn't
make that big of a splash, but since it originally came out, they've made a lot of big
improvements to the game and it's a lot more fun to play. The game is normally $59.99, and it's about two years old now, and it's consistently on
sale for around 15 bucks. At time of writing, it's down to $13.79, but the all time low is
even cheaper at $11.95, an 80% discount. If you don't care about Game Pass, it's a pretty solid price
for a pretty solid game. The actual game play is pretty basic, but ""Ghostwire: Tokyo"" has
immaculate vibes, and, really, when you're playing a
first-person open-world game, that's a large part of the equation, especially when you can get it this cheap. At number 17 is ""Sniper Elite 5,"" the next entry in the long-running
""Sniper Elite"" series. Took about a year to start
seeing some solid price drops, but now you can find it on
sale between $9.99 and $14.99 pretty much all over the place. The all time low is about
$9.24, which is an 82% discount. It's a great deal for a game that doesn't necessarily
reinvent the wheel, but it has the biggest,
most elaborate levels in a ""Sniper Elite"" game yet. The stages are really massive, they're detailed and a
ton of fun to explore. It's like ""Hitman"" if the levels were two to three times as big, and in which you can snipe
an entire platoon of bad guys if you get bored of the sneaky stuff. It's challenging, and the
huge levels can be exhausting, 'cause seriously, they
can stretch on and on, but it's one of the most satisfying things just slowly dismantling a base
piece by painstaking piece. At number 16 is ""Blasphemous 2."" Sure, this sequel is mostly just the first game all over again, and that does hurt its
appeal in some ways, but it's otherwise, I have
to say it, a better game. The controls are tighter, the environments have more variety, and for the most part, it's
only a little less weird than the original game. That's the only downside. The story kind of gets,
I don't know, samey, it just feels like we're
doing the first game again, and the bosses are generally
less grotesquely creative, but in pretty much every other way, the game is better made and more fun. The best thing about it, might I add, the spikes don't kill
you instantly anymore. It's not cheap for being an indie, it normally runs $29.99, but recently it's been going on sale for 50% off at $14.99. But if you're willing to wait, it goes even lower, to
$11.24 at times, 63% off. For a game from 2023, that's
a pretty steep discount. At number 15 is ""Hogwarts Legacy."" Say what you want about this game, but it's proven to be an
extremely popular game that got really solid
reviews across the board. It may not be the most ambitious game, but it is definitely well made. For people who may be
interested in giving it a try but don't wanna pay full retail for it, which is probably what I would have been if this wasn't, you know,
how I make-a the money. I'm not a huge ""Harry Potter"" fan, but I do like this game
quite a bit, actually. It does go on sale for
pretty significant discounts. You can get it for 20 bucks
on a lot of the marketplaces, but if you wanna wait,
you can find it at $14.24, a full 75% off. For a price that low, it's easy to overlook the game's
slightly more glaring flaws and just focus on the fun stuff like wandering around the castle, becoming a mini serial killer and casting death on everyone. It's fun. At number 14 is ""Pathfinder:
Wrath of the Righteous."" With ""Baldur's Gate 3""
refusing to budge on price, it's nice to see that the
other great recent CRPG is significantly cheaper to get. The second ""Pathfinder""
game, it is an excellent RPG that fixes pretty much all
of the first game's mistakes. It's massive, you can easily
spend over a hundred hours or more on it, so you're getting a lot
for what you're putting in. It's not much, either. The game generally sells for 40 bucks, but it goes on sale all the time. At time of writing, it is $11.99, or 70% off, multiple storefronts. If you wanna wait, you
can get it even cheaper. I've seen it as low as
$7.79, which is 81% off. At number 13 is ""Monster Hunter Rise."" A Switch game, so graphically the most
recent ""Monster Hunter"" at the time of writing. Wasn't the best looking game, but gameplay wise, it's the
fastest ""Monster Hunter"" yet, also the cheapest. While ""World"" generally hovers
around 20 bucks on sale, ""Rise"" often drops to just $9.99. It's also been known
to go as low as $7.01, which is 82% off, which is a steal for a game with as much
content as this one. You don't get the expansion at that price, but the base game should give
most monster hunters more than enough to keep
them busy for 10 bucks. In presentation, ""Rise"" is a throwback to the older ""Monster Hunter"" games, but in practice, a lot of
what's going on in this game is going to be incorporated
into ""Monster Hunter Wild."" It's not just a side game,
it's a true continuation. Honestly, in a lot of ways, I
like it better than ""World."" In some ways, I don't, but,
yeah, it's a great game. At number 12 is the
""Resident Evil 4"" remake. Capcom's always a solid source
for some of the best games that are also dirt cheap. Take ""Resident Evil 4's""
remake from last year. Online, you can already
buy it for 40 bucks, it's often on sale on Steam for $22.59, and if you really want to get it cheap, it has gone in deep
discount as low as $14.40. Less than 15 bucks for
one of the best remakes of one of the best games of all time. It's the remake nobody
thought needed to be made, but Capcom kind of proved us all wrong. You might still prefer the original, but that it's even in question proves how good the remake is. It's one of those games
where individual changes might spawn arguments
about which one is better, but overall, the remake is excellent, and in my opinion, it's unambiguously good that the tank controls are gone. Also, the addition of a breakable knife that can parry most attacks makes the combat more active and intense. It's a brilliantly designed game that looks and sounds great, so getting it a year after
it originally came out for only 15 bucks is a no brainer if you're a ""Resident Evil"" fan. At number 11 is ""Gravity Circuit."" There are so many retro indie games that the ones that stand out anymore really have to be something special, which is exactly what
""Gravity Circuit"" is. It's a ""Mega Man""-like, but
the quality is spectacular. It's old school, but just
a massive amount of fun. It's cheap, too. Normally, it's at the
slightly high price of $16.99, but $6.80, I mean, that's like 60% off, but it's a good price. What makes the game so great is the many movement
powers you have access to. It's a speed runner's dream game, and it can also be played
by just about anybody. At number 10 is ""Warhammer
40,000: Darktide."" The co-op follow up to
""Vermintide"" had a rough start, but it's been getting
better with each update. It's a great looking game. It's got some of the best
co-op action out there, but it's not cheap, so
discounts make a big difference. Currently, the best price you can get the game for is $21.99. That's 45% off, but you can do better. The all time lowest price is $16.92, which is a full 58% off, which still isn't the cheapest thing, but it's better than the $40
the game normally sells for. At number nine is ""Tomb
Raider I-III Remastered."" The original ""Tomb Raider"" games are kind of an acquired taste. The tank controls and
precision platforming is gonna scare some people
off who aren't here for it, but if you are, there's a solid remaster of three stone cold classic games. Not cheap, 30 bucks is a big asking price for such old games, but the sale prices are
way more reasonable. You can get it on steam for $14.99, but the historical lows are even better. If you're willing to wait, the collection has dropped to even $12. The first game's probably still the best, even if it's the most archaic, but in some ways, that works in its favor. The lack of enemies really plays to the strengths of these games, which is actually the platforming. It takes some serious getting used to, but they have a certain atmosphere to them that makes them really
good despite any jankiness. At number eight is ""Lego Star
Wars: The Skywalker Saga."" Easily the best Lego game in a long time, it's perfect for parents,
kids, and kids at heart, which is the nice way of
saying man-baby, I guess. And I don't mean that as an insult. I know somebody will take
it that way, but it's not. It's a fun game, and here's a plus, it might help you decipher
what the hell is supposed to be going on in ""Rise of Skywalker."" On digital storefronts, it's 50 bucks, but it's on sale all
the time for a lot less. Currently, the best price
you can get is $11.49, which is 77% off, but it's gotten to the
full 80% discount at times at just $9.99. At number seven is ""Doom Eternal."" This crazy FPS is a game everyone should experience at least once. You can't really call
yourself a true gamer in the contemporary
times unless you have had to suffer through the Marauder. Now, this game is hard as
hell, but it's crazy cheap. Like, this game is going for
like $9 on some storefronts. It's gone even lower than that, though. You can get it at $6.99
if you're really looking. Come on, guys. Get the price to $6.66. You're already so close. ""Doom Eternal"" isn't really
like the old ""Doom"" games, it's something new and different. More of an action game in
first person than a retro FPS, but man, it's a hell of a game. At number six is ""Severed Steel."" There's so many great
FPS indies coming out, but ""Severed Steel's""
probably the standout, with its slow down time powers and lightning fast brutal game play. It's a fantastic FPS that's
a ton of fun to play, but the regular price is
just a bit high at $24.99. The sale price spectacular, though. It goes down a full 90% off to $2.49, and it is one of the best indie FPS games in the last few years. It's fast, furious, at
times extremely tough, but it all goes by so
fast, you can jump back into the action in no time. And hey, you don't just die instantly, so it's not quite as
frustrating as it could be. At number five is ""Resident Evil Village."" Whether ""Village"" or the
""Resi 4"" remake is better is up to you, but the
one thing that is not up for debate is which is cheaper. Yes, remake is getting
cheaper, but ""Village,"" they're just practically giving away. The game often goes down to
$15.95, which is 60% off, but it has been known
to go as low as $6.79, which is 83% off. This is a first-person ""Resi"" game, and it feels like practice
for what they eventually did with the remake of 4. It's got a shopkeeper, weapons to upgrade, a run-down old town to explore,
and a campier atmosphere compared to the grindhouse horror of 7. It's an oddball game, but when
it comes to pure horror fun, it's one of the best games in the series. At number four is
""Marvel's Midnight Suns."" Another Marvel game, another
game that underperformed, but it's actually a lot
better than you might think. Created by Firaxis, the guys
behind the ""XCOM"" games, ""Midnight Suns"" is a tactical RPG that's also kind of a visual novel. Weird combination, but it does work. It's a game people might
be cautious to try out, but you're not losing much with how much it's been
marked down lately. It consistently goes on sale for $11.99, but it's gotten even lower. Certain storefronts
have had it for $10.44, which is 83% off. It's cheap, but don't let that fool you. It is a big budget game
through and through. The card-based system is kind of weird, but the way you make friends
and interact with the heroes on the team is often pretty
charming, if not unusual. It's just a really unusual game for having the sort of budget it's got. It's often cheesy as hell,
but it is a Marvel game, so the writing, while cheesy,
can also be very charming, and the tactical battles are fast and fun. It's a minor classic that has
been unfortunately overlooked, but hey, it is at least cheap. At number three is ""The Great
Ace Attorney Chronicles."" They finally brought the
missing ""Ace Attorney"" games over to the West in 2021 with ""The Great Ace Attorney
Chronicles"" collection, which combines two of the best games in the entire ""Ace Attorney""
series in one package. It's one of the best stories
in one of Capcom's best series, and now it's also very cheap. $39.99 is a lot to ask for
what's essentially a visual novel with, you know, puzzles thrown in, but on discount, the
game's totally worth it. It's currently selling for $13.75 online, but it can go even cheaper. Lowest known price goes
all the way down to $11.94, which is 70% off. At number two is ""Inscription,"" a 2021 indie that is so
much more than it seems. It's a game that starts off as one thing, but eventually becomes
something completely different, and then crazier from there. It's a cool game that you don't
even have to dig in deeper past the standard rogue-like mode, and for $7.99, it's definitely worth it compared to the normal $20 price. This one's really just way
more than it appears to be. And finally, at number one is
""Dredge,"" a humble indie game that combines two things
that are great together: fishing and cosmic horror. Unique mixture, I know,
but it works perfectly and adds some much needed danger to the basic gameplay
loop of netting fish. Normally sells for $24.99. It's normal sales aren't super noteworthy with a 45% discount to
$13.74, which is pretty good, but it's historical low is
$1.71, a massive 83% discount. And on a game that's only
been around for a year, that's a hell of a drop,
especially for one that, for more or less, has done pretty well. I doubt we'll see the game lower in price much again anytime soon, but at less per the price of
a candy bar at a gas station, ""Dredge"" is a steal. And that's all for today. Leave us a comment, let

right the one and only the legend himself Messi is officially in fortnite and they gave him to me early so big shout out to them I'm going to show you his two new skins and everything else that comes with the set plus I'm going to try a challenge where I win a game by only using his Argentinian Jersey colors blue and white but make sure to watch the whole video cuz I find an item that's not supposed to be in the game Let's jump into it before we jump into the video I wanted to give a huge shout out to Marvel Rivals for sponsoring this video if you love fortnite and you love Marvel you'll need to check out this new game coming out on December 6th because you can get a free Marvel glider in fortnite Marvel rivals' new hero shooter game designed for actionpack 66 PvP with some awesome features including team up abilities a destructible environment and an absolutely incredible roster of 33 Marvel characters all of which are free to unlock at launch it's enabled on all platforms with crossplatform play supported this is the perfect game to play with all your friends join me now and dive into the action with one of the most anticipated free-to-play hero Shooters of this year right now there's a limited time fortnite crossover event where you can unlock the Marvel glider for free all you have to do is play 10 matches of Marvel Rivals before January 6th 2025 don't miss this chance to flex the Ultimate Marvel themed gear get in on the action and claim your glider while it lasts thanks again to Marvel Rivals for sponsoring and let's get back into the video that's right we officially have Messi in fortnite and we got two skins we have this one here Lionel Messi it says fight to reach your dream part of the Lionel Messi set and look at him he looks exactly how he looks in real life it's insane he also have cble Styles and a built-in emote so let's go ahead and click on edit and you will see that he has the might style where he turns into a white lion and then the Zeal style where he turns into a Gold Line these are actually pretty insane honestly and if you're a messy fan you got to be happy here's this built-in emote the main event which is a great name ooh okay yeah he literally turns into a lion starts roaring that's pretty cool now second skin is the street wear spark messy he's a bit more chill he has headphones on he has a hoodie his name's on the back and he's glow pink or/ purple he's reactive and has selectable style so let's check those out you can see you can turn the headphones on or off you can turn reactivity on or off as well in terms of back blinks we have the number 10 which is of course his number has a crown on it too and then we also have the portable playmaker which uh is like a little game device with Messi shooting a soccer ball there go love to see it for pickaxes we have two of them we have fancy football which is uh really really cool looking and then we also have the goated glaive you know there's talk who's the goat Messi or Ronaldo well now he has a goated pickaxe in fortnite and then for emotes we have the number one fan llama from his famous meme you'll love to see it and for this back bling here you can actually take off the crown and just have his number 10 if you do want to support me in the item shop when picking up Messi go to the shop go to the bottom right you'll see supported Creator tap on that type in Typical Gamer now you can do it lower case uppercase or fancy like me just type in Typical Gamer no spaces hit search you're going to see a check mark and then you're going to see my my name in the bottom right if you see my name there that means you're supporting me it goes away once in a while so if you would punch it in before you buy anything I would really appreciate it oh my gosh I can't believe I'm actually playing as Messi in fortnite you know I'm a Ronaldo fan but I'm going to go ahead and uh let it slide seriously he looks so cool got the pickaxe on too let's do the transformation emote ooh yep now because he won the World Cup with Argentina I'm going to do gray and blue weapons only let's pretend gray is white now I'm actually going to land in a very special location right over here on the map yep you may not have known this but there is a soccer field in fortnite right now you'll love to see it I'm going to go ahead and start off by picking up this gray pistol pop this open we got a chest let's go ahead and score with Messi let's do it from half it's good goal celebration time ooh oh wow you can turn into the Gold version I didn't know that I thought it would just tur it back to the normal one oh I completely missed it's okay we're going to pick it up off the side off the post go look how detailed this Lon is too he looks really cool okay between every elimination I'm going to change I think starting with Messy I need to find some blue weapons though and let's pop some heals ooh chest over here come on all right a lot of stuff I can't use until no I also can't use that wait I can use this as SMG I feel like nobody knows about this spot really but there's decent loot here because of the loot might be one of the best spots to land right now come on give me something I could use please pretty please we got the nice sweet over here to watch the game one more chest give me what I want ah they're making the go War for it can we can actually buy something from this vending machine let's go ahead and buy a on shotgun and we're going to be on our way I gave him the Incredibles car because why not it looks cool look at the soccer balls now look I'm actually portug so I'm more of a Ronaldo fan but I'm going to say something really controversial here they're both the goats all right they're both absolutely insane at the game and you love to see it also I would call it football all the time since I do know Portuguese but uh I'm just going to call it soccer okay let's check over here do somebody open up the Vault nobody's open up the Vault yet oh my gosh what's happening in here I'm pretty injured 180 to the dumb let's go ahead and transform oo now I'm playing with Messi early here so imagine get eliminated by Messi when the Skin's not even out yet like that's pretty wild king needs his crown and I know there's at least uh one more person here so we're going to have to figure that out pop this open though big hit from the line himself Gold version looking sick let's pop this heal okay unfortunately nobody's had like loot I can actually use no my car got him all right everyone just has purple loot truly insane all right gu we get to transform back into Messi three elims looking pretty strong though a lot of people ended up being in this Forest Bater or not another blue shotgun come on fortnite can I loot something that's good for me they're like no break this down come on all green weapons I think every chest I've opened has a green weapon in it or a purple I now have the fire boom though which means I reload my weapons faster which is perfect for this only shotgun cuz takes a long time otherwise three chests in the Middle come on need a sentinel pump shotgun maybe a blue Hollow twister AR all right got shock waves I like that green on green on green on green all right this one will change it for me though still green I uh can't believe it either honestly sounds like there's a chest here though we can place this for a quest thank you and there's a blue pistol let's go hit him a decent amount where'd he go drop down ooh and now we get a blue Fury assault rifle you don't mess with the lion buddy all right yeah the lion roars oh you know what there's a hollow twister AR here I'm taking that sounds like there's a lot of action there I'm going to Shockwave little third party yoink turn to the Gold Line there like one more shot there we go turn back into Messi I guess he's messy at every turn but he's also a white and gold lion oh my gosh no I thought it was a sentinel pump there's a purple one that's insane let's get a water Bon and I'm going to shock wave over here see if I get an angle 30 on him got a lot of ammo he probably has a lot of mats though somebody on the train doesn't look like it going to pretend I'm fighting somebody [Music] oh my gosh this guy's getting wrecked what's connecting it that's on the [Music] ground we shot from every angle there's three people here one down switch up is this the first skin that can transform three times [Music] got him you just wanted to hide all game huh that's how you want to play it you're fighting the goat all purple weapons over here kind of crazy I'm going to go ahead and drop my minis for a void Oni mask I was really hoping that I could find a cental pump shotgun but you know what part of the challenge is using whatever weapons I can find right and if I have to use the uh Oni shotgun then I will unless this chest right here no okay I've only got green weapons out of chest let's grab a car the number 10 on the the back is a nice touch I will say can I flip this guy's car already pre-popped one of the tires but figure I can pull out of the muck here by going to the gas station and we're good to go We're Off to the Races we're in a top 10 situation baby we're going to go ahead and book it over to the Mythic Island but it looks like somebody with a medallion is already there uhoh I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place a hard place is uh the train in this case I can't move this car okay all right is this is this how it's going to go oh you know what honestly really cool is this car is blue and white as well and it's not even my car it's just perfect quick reminder if you want to be a go and level up quick in fortnite go to the left of play and hit search and type in super s u p e r for super red versus blue it's going to be this first one over here it gives you so much xp go play it today don't forget you can also search up Typical Gamer go to creators click on me and you can now favor me and go favor my game Studio Joo too while you're at it all right let's take one of these air drafts up I think the person with the uh Medallion still hasn't gone up yet maybe they have we'll see in a second look like he has not going up I think he's still down below they're fighting in the tunnel I'm going to go check someone just got eliminated oh my gosh absolutely crushed that guy which means I get to turn back into normal Messi wait what the heck dual micro SMGs uh these aren't supposed to be in the game hello okay well I got to use him for just effect here and I got a sentinel pump shotgun which is great Medallion here oh man blessings on blessings on blessings I'm going to drop the mask and this is going to be my load out look at this I mean who I didn't even know you could ride the rail there this looks way too cool I feel like I'm like using a banned weapon right now I mean it's vaulted it's blue too all right we're going up I think I swapped into the right Messi honestly don't remember at this point the SMG is not as effective as I'd hope versus this boss definitely want to use an AR going to hide over here I have the best strats verus this boss oh gosh except for that I did not expect him to be that close doing that oh drop down a sledge Sledge is saving my life oh except for that ow come on need to go down buddy I don't know how that hit me that's all right down goes the boss get The Medallion now when I run I'm in invisible okay it's going to be two tick in a second we make sure everything's reloaded and let's get this med kit ready all righty about full health let's get it all right we are officially back into the zone and out of the storm I see some barrels on the dock here so I'm going to get those just to get my health to full and it looks like I can complete my quest at the same time so perfect easy spear charm has been placed and now I'm running invisible I'm going to use one shock wave just to get me moving here and there's a big pot here cap out guess I can run infinitely and uh I invisible while doing so it's kind of a great cover keep on booking it keep on moving messy take the zip line down got one ofm got transform quick we got to move there's one more person here and shock wave on to him oh transform quick hurts there we go and boom I he more people fighting we're going one more time on the train let's box up while we transform o One V one situation oh this is going to be perfect it's going to end up as me as messy if I win this all right let's go ahead and throw it down the squishy we are using him to fly around wow it's actually ending up kind of where that big fight happened crazy let's get into the car ah yes both tires popped exactly how I planned it see the last guy behind the tree they want a bad but I want more is he safe over there he's mostly safe it pulls to him that sucks for me going to double ramp hit him so hard double ramping up oh midair let's go you'll love to see it baby let's

setup for completely free I'm not spending any   money now I've actually completed this challenge 
twice in the past year but this time I want to   build the best setup I've ever made and the rules 
for building it are simple I can't spend any money   I've got to get every single item on this list for 
the setup to be complete and I've got to do it all   within 10 days and if I don't get it done within 
that time limit then I'm going to punish myself   by shaving my head now at the end of this video 
I want to give whatever I build to a subscribers   so I need to make this the best setup that I 
possibly can and in order to do that my plan is   very simple just completely abuse my social media 
following account so I can get as much stuff off   Brands as humanly possible now yes I know that 
tactic seems overpowered I've already done a run   of this challenge where I didn't use any help 
from Brands and since my hairline is literally   on the line in this video I thought I'd just go 
crazy now since I only had 10 days to complete   this challenge I wrote a list of all the brands 
I wanted to contact and I sent an email to every   single one basically saying hey my name's Dan 
I'm trying to build a setup for free in 10 days   so I can give it to a subscriber as you can see 
I uh very famous so if you send me your product   you know a lot of people want to buy and stuff so 
yeah can you send me some stuff okay thanks bye   it's been a couple of hours and we've already got 
our first response we got an email here that says   of course we'll provide a desk and a chair and 
a chair from my guys at flexi spot only one of   the desk so that's that's actually brilliant I'm 
going to send them a response back and hopefully   we can get this desk as soon as possible now 
obviously we weren't able to get anything on   day one hopefully on day two we have a few more 
responses good morning everybody it is day two   we've got two responses which is very good one's 
from flexi spot they're saying they can send a   desk and chair out tomorrow that that's brilliant 
and then the other brand that we've got is Omen   I've worked with Omen before so I've got contacts 
there and when I say contact I mean I know a guy   who knows a guy who knows a guy at Omen and they 
are willing to send a keyboard mouse mouse M and   a headset so that's perfect I'm going to spend 
my next hour responding to these guys and I'll   update you when I have an update we haven't had 
no more updates which is a bit worrying I don't   want to shave my hair I think it might be because 
it's Sunday and everybody's like sort of off work   uh actually might be the reason so on day two 
we still have nothing but luckily on day free   we got our first [Music] delivery oh my God we 
got our first delivery let's get these open oh my   God what the hell I've never in a chair like that 
flexi spot they hooked your boy up oh this is nice   the chair was incredibly easy to build and once 
I finished building it it look like this a very   good start to the setup but we still had one more 
thing to add now we just got to build a desk w again the desk was incredibly easy to build and 
once I finished building we had a nice desk and   chair combo for the setup now a bad start for just 
day three we've already got our hands on the desk   and the chair with a total value of $1,238 let's 
see what day four has to offer wait wait is that   another package Omen alert we actually got our 
package from Omen today so let's see what they've   sent over oh oh my God there's a lot of goodies 
in here oh my God there is only sent over a whole   care package what we got here we got headphones 
a wireless gaming mouse a whole ass keyboard and   we got an RGB desk mat as well Omen you guys are 
too kind with another four items crossed off our   list it was time to unbox them and add them to 
the setup first up we got the pulse fire gaming   map o oh this is high quality o smells really nice 
too next of all we got the hyperx Ally rise let's   open this up o oh oh that is tasty next of all we 
got the haste 2 Mouse this is very smooth next of   all we got a cloud free wireless which I know 
is good because my sister actually has a pair   of these as always just feel like a good pair 
of comfy headphones I'm going to do some ASMR   keyboard sounds for you oh this looks nice we have 
got quite a good amount of stuff already and a few   hours later I had even more updates I have another 
Omen update people I just messaged the guy at Omen   saying that all the stuff's arrived perfectly 
and it's amazing and he's responded back saying   you want to go to gamescon in 2 days I mean I'm 
not going to say no and plus gamescon is one of   the biggest gaming festivals in the world and 
there is a lot of companies there that I could   you know do a little bit of begging to we'll see 
what happens but I'm definitely going to go but   on top of all that I have even more news in the 
past few hours I've had some responses from Nano   Leaf GTA Omega and even better Omen have said that 
they've put me in contact with AMD who apparently   are going to supply us with a topof the range CPU 
and GPU for our potential PC today has just gone   amazing I'm just reading through GTA omega's email 
I realized we've already got a chair shall we just   get another one and give two away let's do that 
let's get another one I'll see you guys tomorrow   when we've got some more responses from people so 
with day four being incredibly successful we now   have a setup that's worth over $1,684 now on day 
five I didn't get too many responses but later in   the evening I did get a massive delivery Nano Leaf 
sent over there Nano leaf Ultra black triangles   AMD have sent over an incredibly powerful CPU the 
AMD ryzen 5700x they've also sent over that AMD   radon RX 7900 16 GB GPU oh my word this is huge 
that is our PC right now we've probably got about   40% of a PC right there however we've got one more 
package the GTO Omega chair which came obviously   we already have a chair so for now I'm just going 
to put it behind cuz we'll give it to someone   else look at what we've got this is is actually 
starting to look really really good the one thing   I'm worried about is the PC that razor is getting 
closer and closer to my head by the day so by the   end of day five we now have two chairs 40% of a 
PC and the setup is worth over $3,000 now one day   six I had to catch a flight over to Gamescom which 
needless to say was absolutely insane I only had   one thing on my mind getting free items for the 
setup and what's the best way to get set items   stealing I was going to need to pull off the heist 
of the century to save my hairline just look at me   calm and composed these people had no idea what 
was about to happen I slowly approached and made   my way past security once I was in I needed to 
find an item that I could take and there it was   a microphone one of the only things left needed to 
complete my setup I secretly and not suspiciously   took the microphone and put it in my bag okay I 
need to stop this in reality I asked Omen if I   could also have a microphone and they said yes so 
the next day I took it home I am back from Germany   and I brought some with me it's the WR way around 
one second a hyperx quadcast 2 I've never used one   of these before so I guess let's open it up and 
see what it looks like let's plug this in that's   probably one of the coolest looking microphones 
I've ever seen we got a tap to mute feature little   volume knob here it's adjustable this is amazing 
now as you can see we got a whole bunch of goodies   here but we're kind of missing a screen luckily 
while I was at games conon I actually made a   few conversations off camera and uh let's just say 
while I was out there um I managed to get a little   something sent from Germany it honestly looks like 
Omen is sponsoring this video but they are just a   good bunch of guys that have uh wanted to help 
fund this challenge so without any hesitation I   unboxed the Monitor and added one of the final 
pieces left to the setup oh my word oh my God   we have generally nearly got everything here but 
the PC um well the PC is kind of still lacking uh   we actually need to find some components to this 
thing otherwise I'm going to be bor but I don't   want that now by day eight you would think that we 
were doing well since we had only one more thing   to get and the setup was worth over $3,762 but on 
day eight I was getting extremely worried because   still no companies had responded to me so I got 
desperate I had to go online and look at Facebook   Marketplace even after a good hour of searching I 
couldn't find anyone who was selling any PC parts   for free even the PCS that were practically worth 
nothing were selling for something so I made one   last attempt at following up to some companies but 
still I heard nothing back however I realized at   this point I still needed to make the setup as 
best as it could be so on day N9 I made one last   phone call hello hello you all right yeah you know 
when I made that setup for free last year yeah   I'm doing that again basically and uh it would be 
even better if I could have you know one of your   spare monitors that you don't need anymore yeah 
could I have them yeah okay oh anything for free   I will take now the reason why she's got a free 
monitor up for grabs is because the other month   I actually upgraded her gaming setup and there's a 
video coming out of that soon obviously I upgraded   everything in that setup so it means now there's 
a monitor that she doesn't use which I can have   here we go as you can see I'm blowing the name out 
on it because pH uh they didn't send this for free   so they don't get a shout out anyways let's put 
these in the setup now even though we had built   a setup that was literally worth over $4,000 I 
didn't complete the challenge which only meant   one thing oh God my heart is beating I honestly 
thought I'd be able to do it in 10 days here goes nothing oh that's a that's a good [Music] chunk 
well clearly I wasn't able to build the setup   in 10 days however for 10 days we didn't do a 
bad job and don't worry I'm going to fund the   rest of the set upart my own money to whoever I 
give this to but I am bored so yeah [Applause]"

new toy shop Throwdown event brings three troops a spell and an epic piece of equipment so let's tell you everything you need to know the event begins for Town Hall six and above players on December the 11th lasting the entire month but you'll be given a tutorial to start bad news Chief my cookies have gone bad our heroes are on a quest to take them down let's help raid villagers to collect cogs and fill my rocking reindeer this is where you access the event every day you will be able to collect the cogs from they and when you enter you'll be given a rundown of the event attacking in multiplayer to collect them I will talk you through all of the temporary troops and then the toy medals you exchange for rewards in the trader shop and I'll be going over all of those with you as well just by collecting these initial cogs though you have enough to unlock the Kookie which is the strongest of the temporary troops you progress through the event Track by collecting cogs in multiplayer battles these are randomly assigned to three different buildings so they could be non-defensive buildings they could be regular buildings and as the event goes on typically the amount of cogs within a building will scale up over this means you can complete the event faster towards the end but you wouldn't get as much time with the limited edition troops and you will want to use them because they are powerful I will personally be using the giant arrow to get these very quickly but you could use lightning or Santa surprise spells as well you will just gain these as you are regular regly attacking though obviously a three star meaning that you had to have taken down all three of the buildings and got the maximum amount of cogs for that attack it will require 16,000 to get to the end of the track but in terms of the limited edition troops you unlock the Ice Wizard at 1,000 points the Santa surprise spell at 2,000 points and the ram Rider at 3,000 we do have a video sponsor for this one so I will cover the rest of the event details afterwards thank you to good goo muffin for sponsoring today's video goo muffin is a free fantasy MMO RPG with Idol gameplay designed

description to start your fantasy Adventure thanks again to goo muffin for sponsoring today's video once you get to the end of the event track you will unlock your rocking reindeer decoration and you can begin to complete the bonus track this will require another 21,000 cogs to complete in which you can collect an extra 650 toy medals to spend in the trader shop this means as a free-to-play player you can earn 3,750 toy medals from completing the track 5,000 shiny or and 400 glowy ore and remember all players can also gain the 30% training discount which does stack on top of your gold pass discount if you are purchasing the event pass though remember you will get 1,000 bonus medals to get you started which is enough to unlock the Ice Wizard and you can support a Creator beforehand by pressing the C and entering their code my code is Judo and it is very much appreciated you can also purchase on the supercell store to earn extra Rewards D once you've claimed everything from the event pass if you've purchased you will have 9,250 toy medals to spend in the trader shop and there is a big difference this time around yes we have the new epic piece of equipment the electro boots but should you have missed some of the Epic equipment previously some of them are now available from this event we've gave this feedback before and I'd love to see this implemented into the regular super troop events when there isn't a new piece of of equipment as well so that fre two-player players could also catch up the electro boots is for the Royal Champion so maybe you miss that if you are a lower Town Hall level player and opt for either The Gauntlet for the king the Frozen arrow for the queen or the fireball for the grand Warden they all tend to be 1,500 gems in the trader shop so should you go back to the electro boots you could always get that later needless to say though even though you can get better gem conversion when you purchase the ore over the equipment I just recommend the equipment because obviously the ore you don't need to gem versus getting the equipment if you want it currently that's the only way to get it by the way I would love to see equipment in the cwl shop as well but for the electro boots that is 3,100 medals I will be getting that as a top priority and then I would just recommend getting whichever or you need for the upgrades but let's show you the decorations as well because as a bit of a collector I always get these the 3X3 super Deco for this event is the snow globe at 3,100 toy medals but there is also the Clockwork choir for 1,025 quickly going over the electro boots before we cover the limited edition troops and the spell this is an epic piece of equipment for the Royal Champion which means it can be upgraded to level 27 think about the aura damage of the electro Titan this does exactly the same thing copy and pasted across to the Royal Champion but it does deal more damage whilst this does not really matter when it comes to skeleton traps that pop up they will be instantly fried it will be interesting to see whether this can be combined quite well with the seeking Shield to one shot defenses better but moreover the hero boosts provide selfhealing per second this is the only piece of equipment for the Royal Champion that does this so for every second your Royal Champion is on the battle field she is regaining 60 hit points it does not sound like much but you never know when that is the differ refence maker on keeping your Royal Champion alive when you just about get that invisibility spell in or not with the additional 700 hit points of this equipment as well this gives the Royal Champion an overall health of 4,868 this could be increased with other pieces of equipment but essentially this means that you could fully recover your Royal Champions hit points in 81 seconds you may not be likely to have the Royal champion on the battlefield for that length of time unless you deploy her first along inside the spear to take out defenses but that is an extreme example so you can see how the selfhealing would work moving to the limited edition troops though first you unlock the cookie which is my favorite troop for this event works exactly the same as last year it is very similar to a valkyrie especially mechanic wise how it operates with the Whirlwind attack it has the exact same hit points at max level but the damage per second is over 43 times times that of a valkyrie the cookie troop can still one shot the town hall it is 10 housing space so a little bit more than a valkyrie but for that increase in damage it is well worth it last year using the cookies alongside the root Riders was a phenomenal strategy I will not be doing that myself this year at Town Hall 17 the Nerfs to the root Riders just mean that it's not as powerful I am sure it will work at some of the Lower Town Hall levels but at Town Hall 17 I will use the cookie rather than a baby dragon to funnel that is because it has more hit points than the baby dragon and as we've established it One-Shots any building so you can easily funnel the outside of the base without worrying about a Seeking Air Mine so it's fantastic for your ground attacks next up we have the return of the Ice Wizard this offers a different variant to the regular Wizard and it really depends on what you are using the troop four the Ice Wizard has more hit points than the regular wizard but deals slightly less damage this is to counteract the fact that their favorite Target are defenses and in attacking those defenses they will also be slowing them down they for protecting the ice Wizards and the rest of your army so for situations where you would be using a wizard to deal damage for example behind a tank if you have a Golem out in front with a couple of wizards behind the Ice Wizard would be a better option for you if you are trying to funnel an area of the base well then the ice Wizards only target defenses so should there be non-defensive buildings in that area you might need to take a regular wizard this is exactly the same if you are using the wizard as a cleanup troop because clearly the Ice Wizard would not clean up those non-defensive buildings and the movement speed is also slower than the regular Wizard and obviously in terms of cleanup the faster you can be the better so if you are wanting to use this as a damage troop the Ice Wizard is better as a funneling or cleanup troop the regular wizard is the way to go the ram Rider again works the same as last year it is defense targeting and will rush to the closest defense breaking any walls on Route and when it gets there it will initially freeze the defense as well after this it turns into a long ranged hog rider operating exactly the same jumping over walls being defense targeting but it can fire from that little bit more range meaning that you could catch these with an invisibility spell a little bit easier as well at 12 housing space it is significantly more than a hog rider but it has way more benefits on top of what I just mentioned in freezing the defense breaking the walls on Route it has far more hit points and damage per second to give you an idea the hit points are comparable to that of a giant and the Damage per second is comparable to that of a wizard remember the level of the limited edition troops or spell is based on your town hall level so they begin at level one for Town Hall six players and scale all of the way up every town hall to level 12 for Town Hall 17 players also you are unable to donate any of these inside the clan castle when it comes to the use of the ram Rider I do like to use it as a wall breaker it is only slightly more housing space than a super wall breaker but it doesn't have the same pathing should there be open wall compartments it can just break right on through because it goes to the closest defense so they're a little bit more predictable whether this be diving your king into a compartment or also alongside a queen charge whilst you could use them in a mass attack after any opener whether that be a blizzard or a queen charge I personally like the Kookie troops a little bit better and I do think they are easier to use lastly the Santa surprise spell way better than it ever was we've had the Santa surprise spell for a number of years now but it's always been quite unpredictable as to where the presents land and deal the damage this time it is way more concentrated if you tap an air defense you will one-hot that air defense because the total damage at max level is 1,950 exactly the same as a maxed level air defense normally you need three lightning spells to take down an air defense and a lightning spell is only one housing space so that is three Spell capacity however the Santa surprise spell is only two Spell capacity this means alongside the giant arrow you could wipe out all of the air defense easily meaning you have more spells for your air attacks so we have groundbased troops and a spell that is definitely more helpful for air attacks in terms of strategy I do think at Lower Town Hall levels the root Rider and cookie troop will be effective but at Town Hall 17 it is all about the dragon meta so this is how I will be implementing the Santa surprise spell to an army typically you always want to try and get at least one air sweeper with your giant arrow you are flexible though because you have two Santa surprise spells which you're probably going to use to take down other air defense so let's use the giant arrow I'm going to try and purposely Miss because I could actually get two air defense and two sweepers here so I'm going to try and just get one sweeper alongside one air defense there we go now let's use the king I like to use a Yeti blimp in order to set up pathing on the opposite side of where my king and queen was so let's rage that and that can set up funneling there then we can basically send the dragons down the bottom towards this air defense of the grand Warden and we can use the Santa surprise spell to the other air defenses in order to make sure we take those out you also want to use the minion Prince to the side of the Dragon dragons so that you can funnel them into the center of the base you also want to use your Warden ability through this area look where the poison is from the town hall let's rage alongside those keeping that minion Prince ability as soon as he faces up over then I'll use the Ability there is our minion Prince ability going off can freeze those scatter shot again we can use the skeleton spell on the back end to distract as long as you prioritize the sweepers and air defense which you've got the giant arrow you've got the Yeti blimp you've got the Santa surprise spells then use your rage and freeze to get through the high Splash damage areas your dragons will cruise through the base but let me know how you plan to use the event troops and YouTube has a recommended video of mine for you on the screen which I'm sure you will like enjoy the rest of your day"

Welches Auto fährt man? Kauft man jetzt die Wurst aus gepresstem Schwein oder die aus gepresstem Soja? Hält man öffentlich zu Dieter Bohlen oder doch zu Thomas Anders? Die Realität ist so verwirrend, dass es gut tut, einfach mal in eine nicht-politische, digitale Welt abzutauchen. In die Welt der Computerspiele. Gaming, Twitch, Steam – diese Begriffe sind Musik in unseren Ohren. Doch einen Haken gibt es auch online: Menschen, vor allem Männer in Internet-Subkulturen. Surprise: Die Probleme der realen Welt verschwinden im Internet nicht, sondern verlagern sich nur. Wie unpolitisch kann eine Szene sein, in der Rassismus, Sexismus und rechtsextreme Communitys zum Alltag gehören?

aura around yeah Shadow and Venom together that's the suffocating fumes but you know what honestly I would think of a gas it's like gas gas fruit it's like a fart you know we have bursting Vapor okay this is the bursting Vapor something circling around him like Aura like a blade oh the range is not good though you see the range the range is too close the range is yeah the range is a little bit close have the mo which is SM demon see dude 100% sure this is legendary or even a mythical fruit this is legendary or mythical fruit and look at that that is op no no no no no no no no no is that hit seeking you don't have to aim it didn't say but it doesn't look like you have to aim though it looks like it just auto lock what is that oh okay the traveling gas oh the traveling gas is like the other fruit like smoke fruit where you pass by they get they get damage yeah all right and then last up we have the m1's for the yo this is 100% legendary to mythical if the fruit has an M1 it's like yeah it's good that is a good most of you guys have been waiting for what the transformation hands down hands down hands down hands down mythical fruit mythical fruit this is better this got to be higher than Spirit look how big that is that's bigger than Buddha and it has like a sword dude a budha with sword it's like a budha with a light sink cuz it has M1 the thing is it has M1 so you don't need to use melee or sword but here's the problem here's the problem here's the problem you can't use melee and sword or anything else when you're transformed not like Buddha that you can use a sword a melee a gun or anything else but it has its own sword that's a that he has his own sword light light fruit and Ice fruit y AOE is pretty good dude the AOE damage is B this is broken oh no no no no this is a broken fruit right now yeah all right like I said I wanted to show you guys the Z Mo again the Z because it has a special effect when used with the EG Z does really do that much then you press X oh it explodes that thr that is crazy look if you place it down and then you use that the flame exp and next up we have a demons right here n that summ a lot n n it doesn't look like he tried to aim yeah it doesn't look like he's trying to aim though he's just going also have tracking yeah it's tracking it is tracking that's overpowered yeah that's op bro traveling gas which is pretty much is a dash oh just a dash you don't even fly on that sucks G for if you're flying it's got to be like a fart like I'm here we go boys Heatwave Cannon it's kind of like the same one that look at this look at this look at this look at this there's one bad part about this it launches your opponent away and you don't even see him anymore so you can't do combo hold the x dash at and slam them to the ground it's like the same one but instead of just thr on the ground it goes like yeah but this one is like the Buddha where it grabs you and then slams you anywhere but this one slams you even in the wall what if you slam it in the air I don't thought it was before try you can use it for traveling purposes oh okay you know the animation is insane animation is insanely good if you go down you have like a speed boost like gliding right here so if you just tap it if you tap it that's crazy and it now has an M1 you can now level up with dragon if you're level one you're not supposed to use Dragon when you're level one yeah cuz that's going to be so hard but now you can use it to level up yo when you don't have your full meter you become giant a giant zeolis wait wait wait wait wait let's see let's see let's see this let's see this is a hybrid form that's the oh okay okay there a hybrid doesn't make you bigger but it also makes you stronger all right look at the little oh the the Dash has that animation like fire has like a fire he like it's as big as the unawakened Buddha the explosion look at that giant explosion bro AO like half of the island okay in front of pincer no that will be good for combos cuz you could throw them you could throw them and then use the heat wve Cannon yeah you can throw it on the wall and just combo them on the wall more hits now it's M1 is just now this is it this is it hey hey by the end of this video we're going to tell you guys what we think about all this update and we might give away one of these codes transformation is insane dude this one

tornado slam him down oh does he bite the does he bite the did he bite us okay let's see the scorching downfall the is huge bro he just destroyed the whole island if you in the first se you can use Dragon to level up and just destroy every island like this you know what I'm going to do right now this is crazy Dragon so then of you guys who like the video right now will get a permanent dragon so that's drags them along with you and then you can slam them down oh that's the that's the the gronic store that's the flight so if you fly into someone you pick them up and then you can slam them back

wings are like the m one like that's going to be good for a grind this one is like a real real dragon from The Games of Thrones dragon this is what it looks like but let's see the skills let's see the skills this one is kind of the same just without the charge without charging it how far can you go this is too far if it going to hit is it going to and it hits right here 6 it hit 6,000 damage that is half your health oh okay okay that bad that bad okay see scorching downfall oh what is this oh o That's that like circle thing that is the one that we just saw like a rip inja posted that is the one the skills might be the same but the animation is different this version of dragon is better than the first one 9,000 damage that for grinding will be good cuz you just attack the whole island yeah you don't need to move all you need to do is use one skill oh what is that oh it's the same thing it oh okay basically launches you forward and you get a speed boost it's like a it's like a dash wo wo wo wo wo what is this what is this what wait wait what is this oh Berry what that's a green what what is that it's like a green toad bear and what is this a PlayStation what is this what is this what is happening right now oh oh Michael Jackson he is Michael Jackson wait what what do you think happened wait what do you think happened when he drank it he turned his hacky color ooh it's a hacky color this is the new hacky color the cup has like different colors and then you ask for what color you want and then you drink it and look where we at oh that's the Manion you know those doors that are not open yet yes exactly that's the one that is the one also you know those berries that he grab maybe the berries like there's a green Berry for a green yeah maybe you can get some different color of berries and then you can use it as a hcky because right now you can just randomly get it from I don't know where this is the tiki Outpost now it's freezing it's Frozen right now before it was just raining now it's freezing it looks way it's way bigger yeah it's way way bigger it's like twice as Big O support 01 sub submarine is this a submarine are we going to have a submarine in Blox fruits hey we're going to find those sea beasts we're going to find those Sea Beast oh ooh the two dragons oh the black dragon wait what is that wait what is that wait so there's so you can ride you can ride the Western Dragon oh that is insane the black dragon looks tough yeah that is tough wait wo wo this is the dragon V4 this is the dragon race V4 oh what is that now when is the update what do you think about this the dragon Graphics are just insane in the range of that Z move it's like you could hit them from across the map oh which one do you want the Western or Eastern probably the Western dude I I would go with the Western too because that is a real Game of Thrones dragon so we got gas fruit we got two dragons gun reworks a dragon v before but you know what they didn't show the divine art oh yeah it's the divine art coming up in this update they also showed new you eyes that's coming out that they never shown before and then there's Volcano Island a new quest for Dragons I think those Quest are for like getting the the Western Dragon I think the Western Dragon might be stronger than the Eastern Dragon so what would you rate this from 1 to 10 I think this might be the best update yet yeah it has to be so this one what would you rate it I would rate it 11 out of 10 I would rate it 12 out of 10 and when is the release date of the update December 14th let's go let's go but wait it's 2025 oh hey oh there you J you got us there yeah"

Release Date: 2025",gameranx,"new game announcements,brand new games,top new games,new game awards games,new games coming 2025,upcoming games 2025,new game coming soon,new game trailers,new game reveals,gameranx,falcon",Gaming,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture",2024-12-13T15:50:21Z,0:13:53,703003,1772,,True,"- [Falcon] The game awards
is always when we find out about a ton of new games. This game awards absolutely
did not disappoint. Hi folks. It's Falcon and today on GameRanx, the top 20 brand new games
of the Game Awards 2024. Starting off at number
20, ""Viking's Destiny"", a survival strategy, role playing game, putting you in the role
of a Viking Clan leader. Basically, your goal is
to expand the settlement and lead everybody to prosperity. You want to help all the
other Vikings win at life. This game's gonna have
a dynamic season system and the changing weather's
gonna significantly impact gameplay, particularly in
the survival direction. Looks like an interesting game. ""Viking's Destiny"" is
coming to PC in 2025. And number 19 is ""Thick as
Thieves"", a co-op heist adventure where you assemble a
crew of skilled criminals to pull off high stakes robberies. They're touting an adaptive AI system, which is interesting on account now that AI mania is happening, games are talking about their AI again. Maybe NPC AI is about to
get interesting again. That would be nice. ""Thick as Thieves"" doesn't
have a release date, but it's coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox series. And number 18 is ""Stage Fright"",
an atmospheric horror game. Interesting concept.
You're a theater performer. No one more haunted than
those, actually, I'm joking. They're usually some of the
least haunted souls in the world, but this particular one is haunted by mysterious ghosties during rehearsals. But I think the claim
to fame here is the fact that the game is going to
integrate real time voice recognition, and it's not going to just extend a voice commands. You're gonna have to sing. Horror games often force people to overcome their fears in certain ways. This is a new one, and if you play this with other people in the house, how many people are gonna play this game and be like, (quietly)
here I go again, my, oh, going down the only road I've ever known. (normal) I dunno, this is a cool concept. It doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to PC
sometime in the future. And number 17 is ""Screamer"" a racing game, which is touting itself as
having chaotic tracks filled with hazards and shortcuts. Of course, the idea of a game called
""Screamer"" better be Speed and it apparently is, they're
introducing something they're calling the Rage Boost Mechanic, which rewards aggressive
driving with temporary bursts of speed, which I mean, I get a rage boost when I
am driving in real life, typically doesn't mean that, but that sounds like a good mechanic. ""Screamer"" is coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026. And number 16 is ""Shadow
Labyrinth"", a dark fantasy RPG, in which players will be
exploring a sprawling labyrinth, allegedly uncovering the
mysteries of a Cursed Rome. Oh, and it's a Pacman
game, just so you know. It's kind of like a Pacman
went Hollow night. I guess. The Amazon Secret Levels
anthology episode based on Pacman is actually based on this game, which has been in
development for four years. Looks completely insane,
honestly for a Pacman game. Also just looks like a
pretty decent metroid venue. Honestly, I like the
style of the graphics. Shadow Labyrinth is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch 2025. And number 15 is ""Dave
the Diver: In the Jungle"", the highly anticipated
sequel to the hit indie game. This time Dave trades the ocean for a lush jungle river system. I mean, it's not gonna be
fundamentally a different game here, but I mean there's a lot of different stuff about
jungle rivers versus the ocean. Plus it seems like there's gonna be some tree climbing as well. So in some ways this may be
a lot more varied of a game. ""Dave the Diver: In the
Jungle"" is coming to PC, the PlayStation and Nintendo
switch sometime next year. And number 14 is ""Backfrosts:
That Long Dark 2"" the highly anticipated sequel. Of course, the underlying
concept obviously isn't gonna change a whole lot in Backfrosts. It's post-apocalyptic, it's frozen. You're gonna have to manage resources and navigate harsh conditions. Obviously a big staple is
the weather and ecosystems, but now you're gonna be dealing with multi-region expeditions
where you're gonna have to survive across interconnected maps. There's also gonna be co-op gameplay and an expanded crafting system, so it looks like it's
meaningfully building on the original. Backfrost is coming
exclusively to PC in 2026. And number 13 is ""Solasta 2"", the sequel to the highly acclaimed tactical RPG. Solasta, obviously not abandoning
the adaption at tabletop RPG mechanics anytime soon. What they're intending
to do here is make it so that there's deeper
character customization. They're thrown in some new classes, but probably what sets
it apart is the overhaul dungeon creation tools, making
it so that players can craft and share intricate, story-driven adventures with the community. And obviously with tabletop roots, that's the way you want to
go, that's what you want to develop as you make sequels
to your successful RPGs. ""Solasta 2"" is coming to
PC sometime next year. And number 12 is ""Project
Century"" an Action Adventure Game, coming to us from the
creators of the Yakuza series. This one, however, is
not set in the, well, I guess semi present day. It is set in 1915 Japan,
and it gives us a grittier and more visceral version of the real time Yakuza type combat. I don't know. To me it looks
cool as hell. I like it. It looks like the intent
is to explore the origins of Japanese organized crime during Japan's transition to modernity. We don't have a release date, but it is coming to PS5,
Xbox Series, and PC. At number 11, there is a new
""Virtual Fighter"" project, which is kind of fricking crazy. Virtual Fighter's been
dead for a long time for the most part, but then
Sega is starting to realize that they literally own
a mountain of gold in all of their various IPs. It's been over a decade, but it's just exciting to see that they're making a virtual fighter game with modern enhancements. This was a trailblazer as
far as 3D fighting games go. It set the tone, the pace, everything. It was pretty much this
and Tekken, like that's how big Virtual Fighter was. I'm excited to play a new
Virtual Fighter game in 2025 when it's supposed to come out. We don't know what platforms. Moving on to number 10, it's
""Rematch"", a new football slash soccer game from the creators
of Sifu, which is, I mean, not what I would expect
for their next project. It is, however, a completely
different take on soccer. Like they're not trying
to be super realistic. It's a very arcade-y
looking game, honestly. I think it's really freaking cool looking. It's hard to get me super excited about a soccer/football game. Not 'cause I don't like 'em or anything, it's just, they're
usually just yearly update roster and minor visual change type games. This, it looks completely different. I'm so excited for this. I'm definitely going to play it. We don't know exactly when, but it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC sometime next year. And number nine is ""Turok
Origins"", reimagining of the Dinosaur Hunter. It's a prequel. It explores
the origins of Turok, which is, I always think it's really
funny when the prequel is like way, way better
looking than the original, but it does look like they're
incorporating survival elements, crafting tools,
setting traps, et cetera. I don't know how far they're
gonna drift exactly from the gameplay of the original. ""Turok"" is, it's a
different beast, let's say, bit of a standout in more than one way. I'm interested to see how this one goes. It's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox series, sometime we
don't have a release date. And number eight is ""Ninja
Gaiden: Rage Bound"". Come on man. We've been wanting a
""Ninja Gaiden"" for a while. Now ""Rage Bound"", of course,
referring to the fact that they are leaning in
to the high speed combat. They are re-imagining it, wanting to blend something
classic with something modern. Obviously that is sometimes a great idea and sometimes not the best, I'm guessing based on this trailer. They know what they're doing. I like the idea, ""Rage Bound""
is referring to the fact that you can build up rage through combat, which unlocks big old cinematic techniques and makes it look even
that much more insane. Like, ""Ninja Gaiden"" is a
traditionally pretty insane game. I'm excited. This is coming to PC, the PlayStations, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch later in 2025. And number seven is ""Gendesign"". A fairly mysterious project
coming to us from the creators of ""Shadow of the Colossus""
and ""The Last Guardian"". We don't know the name of the game. Gendesign is the name of the
developer. I mean, at once, this trailer looks very familiar
and completely unfamiliar. It shows an adventurer climbing up a robot and then blasting off with its head to escape some insane storm and maybe does, but kind of doesn't. I don't know. It was really cool. That's all we know about it right now. But yes, absolutely, 100%. We don't have a release date
or platforms or anything. We just have this trailer and it's a good trailer,
at least, if you know what ""Shadow of the Colossus"" and ""Last Guardian"" are, I
imagine if you didn't know what they are, you'd just be confused. But I think very familiar
and yet very new looking. And number six is ""Dispatch"",
a narrative driven game where you play as an emergency dispatcher. You make critical decisions
that will either save or not save people's lives. It's an interesting looking game. Definitely something
different, like at once, it feels kind of like a
telltale game combined with a management sim of some kind, but doesn't really look
like either of those things, visually speaking. I'm super interested
in where this one goes. It's coming to PC sometime next year. And number five is
""Onimusha: Way of the Sword"" I swear, it's basically like
we didn't have that great of a 2024 guys, let's announce a bunch of
stuff that you guys want for the next two years. Stay involved guys.
It's about to get good. I mean, I don't really know what to say about this other than
it's gonna be an Onimusha game with modern graphics and mechanics. It looks like they want some timing and technique type stuff. Real integrated here. So a little bit of soul's influence, but I have a feeling that it's
gonna be, you know, Onimusha. Onimusha is a pretty distinct game. That's why everybody wants more of it. And they're gonna get it in
2026 on PC, PS5, & Xbox Series. And number four is ""Split Fiction"", a narrative-driven, action
adventure game set in parallel dimensions where you're
gonna be alternating between two versions of the
protagonist, each frankly, with different abilities and story arcs, still the same person, of course. The whole idea is this split reality thing that's gonna involve
interlocking dimensions where like puzzles and events
take place across multiple dimensions and affect each other. I don't know, it looks interesting. Split fiction is also the
first game we're talking about today that has a release date. It's coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series, March 6th, 2025. And number three is an
""Okami"" sequel as if Onimusha and Ninja Guide weren't enough. We're getting a new freaking Okami game. A lot of information
on this is under wraps. We just know it's coming at this point. But mythological storytelling,
beautiful cell shaded art, and intricate ways of interacting with the environment
wrapped up into a heartfelt and mystical story. I'm all here for it. How could you not want more of this? Well, maybe you never played the original, it was a while ago, but
man, was it a good game? I'm excited for Okami
sequel, let me tell you. And number two is ""Elden Ring Nightreign"". Let me tell you, missed opportunity to use the Guns N Roses song ""Night Train"", basically
sounds like the same word, would've been a high octane trailer, especially for a roguelike,
which is what this is, essentially a multiplayer
roguelike set in an alternate version of the lands between, introducing an eclipse
cycle, which is going to change enemy behavior,
environmental hazards, even quest lines. And it looks like a pretty
interesting game to me. It's an expansion,
obviously on the original. I assume it's gonna use a
lot of the original's assets, but it's definitely a new twist on it and I'm excited for that. It's coming next year
to PC, the PlayStations, and the Xboxes. So stay tuned for more info on that. And finally at number one, a brand new game/IP from Naughty Dog. A new sci-fi RPG called ""Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet"". Sounds pretty awesome, honestly. There's a big old interstellar theocracy. Not always a good thing,
often bad, often bad. You're gonna set that right though, or at least set it different, I guess. Sounds like a lot of moral ambiguity type stuff going on here. But you're a renegade prophet and they're dropping you
into this big player driven narrative type thing. You are gonna be the spark that lights the fire, so to speak. You're gonna cause some rebellion, my man. It's a big old galactic oppressive institution that you fight against story. Let's go right? It's Naughty Dog. We don't have any kind of a release date, but it is a PS5 exclusive. I'm excited for it.
Can't wait to hear more. I have a few bonus games for you, ""Kura"", an exploration adventure game where you're exploring
this hand-painted world, unraveling the mysteries
of an ancient civilization. Looks heavy on environmental
storytelling, coming out to PC, don't have a date for that. Next is ""Sonic Racing: Crossworlds"", a cross platform, cross
dimensional Sonic racer coming to pretty much everything, but
we don't know exactly when. And ""Game of Thrones: Kingsroad"", a narrative driven strategy
game set in where else? Westeros, where you'll be
focusing on building alliances and subverting political intrigue in order to gain control of the Iron Throne. This one, we don't know when, but it is coming in
2025, to what platforms? I'm not sure. However,
it does look pretty cool. I don't know. The game awards, definitely a
stacked presentation I think. I think pretty awesome slate
of new stuff on the way. What do you think though? Leave

Technology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture,2024-09-24T20:06:55Z,0:13:31,695388,349,,True,Walmart or Teemu Teemu a Chinese website known for selling cheap stuff and Walmart an American Store known for selling cheap stuff sometimes but which one has the better gaming setup and that's what we're going to find out this is my goofy friend clay he's team teu and I'm team Walmart we have a $600 budget and five challenges whoever can get the cheapest setup Whoever has the best looking setup Whoever has the best performing setup and finally who wins in a one V1 in fortnite and a 1 V one in valerant okay here we go klay's going to be shopping online cuz unfortunately he wouldn't let me ship off to China and I'm going to be shopping in store at Walmart and you can't necessarily record in Walmart so I kind of got to be sneaky let's go Walmart let's go we have $600 as our budget and I'm feeling really confident with teu I'm not going to lie we are about to whoop his ass and bro I instantly ran into a problem with Walmart they had like no PCS BR in Walmart every PC is over $500 Bro Look $8.99 for this it had one ram stick in it one ram stick for $8.99 and what is this HP what are we in school buddy bro I had to end up ordering a PC on Walmart's online website and their PCS were so overpriced I finally found one for 439 not going to lie these specs for that price had to be a scam got a PC for $439 bro it wasn't the cheapest one but it was the only one that looked like it would work because I actually need to like have a chance to against GL hold up what is this one 323 i7 RX 580 keyboard mouse mouse pad and a soundbar but it has literally everything this could literally be the play hold up all right we're adding this one to the cart right now bro I'm so cooked I still got to get a monitor the headset the mouse the mouse pad the keyboard and all I have left to spend is $161 all right this is the cheapest Mouse I'm just going to get this $20 $19.94 to be exact uh mouse pad $188 but this is RGB so I might get it I'm getting this bro these are some good keyboards but they like way out of my budget like bro come on bro bro I have to get all Walmart brand stuff like whatever $20 keyboard so $20 $40 plus 13 I don't know what that is in my head I just know it's not 160 the cheapest monitor I have here I see here is $79 okay it's a 22in monitor but how many hertz does it get 100 wait that's actually a good price okay I'm going to get this $89 for it's $165 HZ there is no way Walmart can compete with these prices so I got my last item some plain black headset for $30 and it's time for me to head out to Walmart and check out this is the fastest cashier I know and he gets there and everything plus the PC my total came up to 601 yeah I went a dollar over now we need clay to finish buying his stuff to see who wins in the cheapest category our total is at 41258 right now we have a good Monitor and we have a good PC but we actually want to win the one1 so even after already having everything he needed he bought a better keyboard This is it right here $20 he bought a better Mouse he bought headsets he bought Travis Scott lights we have to beat him everywhere PA and his total came up up to 550 meaning he beat me the first Challenge on having the cheapest setup but we still got four more challenges so I got a chance and after waiting years for his setup to come from China it's finally time for us to put the setup together to see who looks better what is this a g bro listen bro I got connects all right out there what this is the RGB hey head don't knock it down you're going to damage my stuff bro n it's over it's it's bro there's no way yes sir all right let's see come on bro let's get the building all right let's do it let's go and after starting the unboxing I noticed two things one this is what my PC came with my PC came with the best fortnite settings what the [ __ ] wait wait wait wait there's no troll no I won bro I already know my PC is going to be trash because it came with the best fortnite settings and all the settings are [Laughter] L and this is what his came with okay so this is literally crazy so on top of the actual PC it came with a mouse and a keyboard right here plus a speaker and then again within my budget I also had a mouse and a keyboard here this is too op bro bro mine just came with a PC and a fortnite low settings graphic are you serious let me see did it m come with a keyboard no it just came with the power you're about to lose bro like who who packages who they thought was opening this box Thanos he dude come on what hey I got a black headset like a real wait a minute that got to be racist yeah yours is just big as hell though like like you about to alert like the army base or some [ __ ] rer Roger 32 500 our setups are done and plugged in and they're not looking too bad well his is looking pretty good but now we're going to have a YouTube guest slight he's a default skin from fortnite and a tech YouTuber so he's gonna tell us which setup looks better oh my God a slight oh my God slight 2K how you been slight um I I've been I've been vibing I've been vibing could you say that you've been slightly good no block him I would I would ban him I would block him no man all right I'm going to be very honest all right that's what we need all right s so this right here is the Walmart setup we got a mouse yeah we got a mouse pad ONN Walmart brand we got a keyboard it's got lights bro it's got we got lights we got a keyboard Walmart brand we got a monitor 100 HZ then we got the Walmart PC right here y this case is actually gas though yeah does price matter they're both under $600 well mine might be a dollar over but they're both under $600 okay that okay I'm getting it now all right so this is the team we set up for $550 by the way this is literally $50 less than what I bought for okay all right listen listen we got the all right we got the light up speaker bar okay okay we got a monitor here it was marketed as 165 HZ but it's 180 HZ okay my oh oh my God is right you can stop right there bro are you what do you mean you can stop right there look at these that's better he doesn't even have to say anything else and then bro look at my light bar in the back look at my light bar in the back for 550 10 100% better that's what team T baby all right bro you're racist honestly we see why you pick team teu we love you slight we love you well I've lost two challenges to team teu but we still got three challenges left so don't count me out yet man so for

my gosh it's actually pretty close unless you're the blue team wait man with raft yeah yes follow me and I'll follow you we'll create an Ora bis neither of us wins but it looks really funny I like

is absolutely dominating guys oh I say that and then the blue team took over the winner changes so fast this is nuts Target red we could team up yeah honestly if I was you guys I'd start maybe strategizing with other color colored teams yellow team up with red red and blue truce again you don't have to get first you just can't get third or fourth oh God we're way behind yellow and red we

been my best friend my entire life just moved off to college and I haven't seen him all year and I really want to see him again blue guys who out of these people is the most likely to stop you from winning the money I'll be honest I already knew who I was going to kill coming in I came in with like 10 friends into this tournament and I had one friend left and darara and she was murdered by someone here I'm so sorry spela no oh my gosh but I feel like I have to do this for her we're looking for three more guys no you suck duper Trooper don't do this to me we're looking for three more and you're going to decide one of them thick say your peace um honestly they have much better reasons you can go ahead and shoot me okay a thank you thick what all right here we go it's waffle time oh jeez waffle there's two eliminations left I'm so sorry we're looking for one more this will be the decider of oh you are the top 15 and moving on to the next round Li it's up to you somebody just had to sit here and watch a bunch of people shoot arrows for the past like 30 minutes and now you're going to tell them that they just wasted their time there are some people who need the money but there are some people here that make enough money that this doesn't really mattero you don't need this money wa oh my gosh that was pretty toxic oh oh my god dude well as you can tell new teams you guys are officially in three teams of five this next challenge is a game of protect the president last team standing wins if your president dies you are done we're looking for one set of five people to move on for the chance of $10,000 have you decided on a uh president I would like to volunteer as president I'm also confident that I can do this for my team you may begin now waffles Bridge hold down grouch and just go all right well green team already started building do you think I can go for a long shot not even close I just wasted an arrow Red's towering across oh and they're scared of the arrows they're not doing anything still okay I'm going to keep going diagonal they are bridging towards us I'm thing wait so you guys are moving towards the Green Team what's the plan there well they look kind of like less threatening than red oh you oh you guys are trying to just wipe them maybe we'll see what happens go go go go go go mid all right blue officially took over the middle I feel like that might be literally the Strat to be honest okay we have mid control but the thing is they are definitely going to come in on us keep in mind guys at some point in time if there's no confrontation I will take matters in my own hands and the results will be obvious very very quickly at this point maybe we start even working our way over to Green because we both have to push at the same time or we're both dead all right so red is coming this way officially all three teams are not even on their base anymore yeah we're waiting for them to get in range because if we shoot too early we just waste arrows and they hide the president derer can you go behind a a thing you know we don't we don't need you getting shot oh we're not here to fight no guys stop stop they just said they're not here to fight they just said they're not here to fight I have not missed oh you haven't missed no oh whoopsie oh my Sushi oh no wait so what's the plan uh we're going to go have a diplomatic discussion with green and try to figure this out and maybe stab some people you got your wish Carl what was my wish murder woo okay they're both closing in on us all right everyone everyone I hit the president I hit the president I'm on one heart oh my God duper duper is one heart I can no longer help you good luck can you give us your arrows I have none good luck green can you guys hear me guys we need to both go into the middle together okay that's a good point truce to get to Mid I think they're negotiating dude this is bad they might be but they are both low like if you one tap the president on both sides they'll die it's coming down to it green is going in all right so are we going to bridge together is that the plan right now yes the red team president literally is one heart the Green Team

you're competing for don't forget got it and while they're fighting for the lives in this game I just want to say thank you so much febles for covering the $10,000 prize pool for this competition guys go check out febles my favorite flavor is cookies and cream it's phenomenal and uh it's the best chocolate in the world also don't forget to watch Beast games it's out now on Amazon Prime let's get

them he's going to catch purple no I got stuck on the ladder two one I Su let's go let's go foxy I need you to know something he was IM absolutely going to hit you but he got stuck on the ladder right there that was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my entire life I can't believe that just happened oh my goodness whatever happens I'm I'm proud of us we did kid me too and then there were two libl and foxley you guys are going to hate each other after this let's go you guys feel like you could trust each other pretty well yeah yeah cuz for the final 1 V one it's time for a simple game of split or steal for the $110,000 no oh in Split or steal you guys have two options if both of you pick split then you each end with $5,000 but if one of you picks steel that person gets 10,000 and the other person gets absolutely nothing but if both of you pick steel nobody gets anything take your time do you guys have anything you guys want to say to each other you're the only person I would want to be here with I I trust you I trust you I'm so down to split I don't need that I was already going to tell you I will give you 3K if I want I don't care well really quick guys let's talk about it liby for the sake of it if you won what would you do with the money I would go to California to see my brother foxley hypothetically you click steal you win the $10,000 what would you spend it on I also have a puppy who has had like heart issues since she was born so the bills be quite a lot of money fair enough it's about time to make the decision huh okay okay libl foxley is very far away right now foxley cannot hear you on the other side of that wall tell me what's going through your head $10,000 can not just let me be able to see my brother I will be able to afford and go to college end of the day you don't really know this person that well I mean you literally just met them over Minecraft I know there's the chance that foxley's also thinking the same thing I know you have a decision made my decision's made I need to see my brother all right foxley y he cannot hear you over there tell me what is actually on your mind cuz you guys were very gung-ho both of you guys about splitting but I want to know I mean I have known leapley for a while I trust him but I don't know it's a difficult decision cuz I don't want to betray someone I trust but then again I could have it all to myself $10,000 is a lot of money it's almost exactly double $5,000 yeah exactly foxley would you you blame him if he decided to click steel I would be very disappointed cuz it might end up in the situation where neither of us get the money so it's a risk do you think then that you might actually pick steel I don't know yet I'll have to think about it okay foxley all right guys well you can now go in your chest the green means you will be splitting and the red means you are opting in to steal I want you to make a decision whenever you guys make your decision on the count of three I'm going to tell you guys to put the block on the gold block $10,000 is so much money though again I could take all of the money from myself all $10,000 stealing is 10,000 or nothing all right do you guys feel good I know what I have to do I'm ready I'm ready you can now Place 3 2 1 reveal let's go oh my gosh you guys both split congrats liy and Oxley you just won five grand each"

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

we're going to be playing fortnite on two wildly different setups my current setup which cost about $100,000 to make which includes some of the best gaming peripherals that exist but for our other setup we're going to play on some of the oldest gaming and PC peripherals that have existed since the start of the PC because today we're here to answer the question does newer gaming equipment make you better at fortnite let's find out Welcome Back to Life 25 years ago now we are going to be playing on a PC that can actually run fortnite because that would actually you know we need a PC that play fortnite yeah these are my headphones looking real fly yep not super great so the old school kids might remember when you had to like split the like things like that and then for the mouse the thing with the mouse that is going to be the hardest thing is not only do we not have sad Mouse buttons in the current mouses that we have today we also have no laser pointer this is just a ball now the other crazy thing on top of that is that there's no scroll wheel on this mouse so because of the fact there's no side Mouse buttons or scroll wheel I'm playing zero builds because I literally wouldn't be able to play the fortnite that I could play all right here we are we're loading into our first game here but I want to show you guys on the camera the frame rate oh that's not great okay this is going to be hard all right here we go now I've got no scroll wheel and scroll wheel is normally my pickup bind so I got to be careful of that oh there a Guitar how do I get it I've not used the guitar yet oh wow we might have to do some sense sense upgrades so the the the ball of the of the mouse is like moving me back and forth as I look left it like the ball rolls me back right which is not great I do feel a little bit of delay play though oh do I or is it just a bad Mouse I don't know okay this mouse is awful we're going to have to up sense crazy here yeah no no no all right we're going to need to chill for a sec yeah look at that I I pick it up and it just moves back the other way no no no this is this is actually going to be awful we're going to double sense at least and I didn't even do it evenly I think that's a real player how does the rift work I haven't even used this thing yet that a real player oh my God was wow okay just insane aim for me there I think I'll probably have to go combat shotgun for zero builds now I think because I haven't aggravated an NPC that all the players should be Bots okay all right it's not a bad stop it's not a bad stop so for this video we're going to be counting how many uh AIS I eliminate and how many actual real players I eliminate cuz obviously the AI a little bit easier to eliminate this ball on the mouse is actually so triggering I can't like it it just it it pushes me back and forth I have to like pick it up and then put it down to actually get movement out of this tell you what though headset holds up decent like I can hear things going on so that's pretty good the keyboard's also not that bad it's not mechanical keyboard by any means but like it does the job quite well the mouse I I don't like the mouse the mouse as far as limiting factors go that I can notice from my normal setup the mouse has got to be up there crazy no scroll wheel the actual sense is just off the wall it is hard because the monitor is not big I to to see things does does require extra uh eye strain I would say that a player no that's a cactus all right two kills on the board but we're getting involved into some pretty nasty activity here we got some good gamers in the car that's a real player oh my God I keep you're getting that this is uh zero build he going to hold it down cuz clicking individually on this thing is impossible someone threw grenades at me tow hook let's grab that I think that'll be huge for zero builds oh this monitor is whiny oh here we go footsteps footsteps footsteps footsteps need to hit my shots here literally rolled okay let's go any better upgrades triam laser rifles a shout I forgot that the the fists are in the game right now yeah I want to use this tow hook on people in the cars oh my god get in get in get in how come I can't get in what wait am I going to die now how am I not dead 997 white 93 white how do I get even kicked off in the first place all right we're towed on now oh no put the okay I don't want to fight I don't understand what's going on all I know is that I can't aim this is hard this is actually very hard I'm going to be honest everybody at home I don't know if we're going to win today I'm trying to think what guns would be the best I think it might actually be me need to go back to combat because if I don't hit my Maven shots it's all over I literally can't shoot like it's insane okay someone using a guitar probably going to try and land on me oh I think I'm getting a headache though I'm not going to lie this is hard so we got a tow hook we'll tow hook this guy and then try to shoot him out the front all right he's got Nitro though get him before he gets into that all right well we miss here we go we're tow hooking this guy oh it's like delay projectile we're on we're on we're on oh the aimim let's go okay yeah we need to ditch this for a uh a combat shotgun but until then we'll get an upgrade all right what's going on here yeah no no no all right let's tow this guy all right we're on r on we on run I think I'm just going to use the rifle oh my God we barely got that one please nobody keep me right now oh my God go go we got the nucca popped but they're on our tail it's so hard to aim on this they still chasing no they're not okay good yeah they are oh where's the rift spawn how much health we got 500 I can barely see it on the edge of my screen yep they are still chasing cuz I can't how has he got a t is that him switching the T go for that guy now go for that guy switch targets I don't know why I'm not looking behind I can literally look behind yeah we're chilling yeah see the bunkers were like really good ideas until I realize that they don't do anything if people have cars all right and we're back baby five elim no six elim couple real players too all right we be careful here yeah these guys oh don't have my tow hook anymore I dropped it wait what we got going over here oh they're trying to go to the bunker all right actually lowkey might drop my bunker they're fighting over here there's a crown on the floor we can try and run him over that would be ideal think I'm getting tow hooked uhoh run into the bunker yeah blocked it off nice good stuff Lin this our bunker yeah trying to come oh my God so dead what am I meant to do what am I meant to do I was going to hit my shots but you want me to hit my shots with this all right so let's go for a little bit of a review on kind of the the setup we had here even though these look laughable these like they did the job like honestly probably seven out of 10 not a headset but like it it did the job next up keyboard keyboard actually like pretty fast response time with the keys like it didn't take like 5 years to like do anything it still actually keyboard valid I don't think it held me back at all I'd give it like A8 out of 10 like it's actually decent monitor I can't see everything on my screen but honestly I had all the information I needed 6 and 1 half out of 10 7 out of 10 like it actually was pretty good this on the other hand I'm giving two out of 10 barely gets the job done this whole like wheel like ball thing there's a reason we got lazy now but I get that they didn't have that Tech back then that was the old school setup let's go to the new school moving on to the next setup we are jumping 25 years into the future to play on the latest of gaming Tech my current gaming setup includes a zoi Youtube mouse an Apex Pro keyboard and an acon rig 900 Max HX headset and a few assus monitors and a pretty Beast PC oh it just feels so good yeah much better frames I get to see my whole screen I have to like squint and zoom in oh this is this is this is this feels so much nicer so the keyboard I'm using now actually has a custom setting where you can change the actuation pressure of certain keys so I've changed it so that my e key goes off on just the slightest actuation of pressure um that way I can edit faster all right then we've got a convoy coming over I want to try and get these mythics let's frag out and win this game let's go show why this setup is goed got a player over here titer shots and yep you're dead oh my God [Music] okay chill chill chill chill chill I got to warm up bro I'm so used to like having so much struggle actually aiming all right let me just warm up a little bit okay I've just been using the worst mouse ever made quite literally probably cuz it was the first mouse ever made all right so far so good we got to get this Medallion over here that's for sure I imagine we're going to have quite a few gamers in this Lobby it's actually so jarring just playing on that setup and going straight over here I feels just like so weird all right let's grab a tow hook I have a feeling we will need it Andy what if I got to beat six elims I think we can get that done okay it looks like we've got a crime scene going over here and I think the AI won that won that fight he had him so close as well he almost got the job DB sucks to suck no no Leela is that her name Leela from future with the one eye I mean PC gaming has come a long way now we download games and play them online but before that we had to put in disc drives which is like you know not too ancient of a technology before disc drives we had something called floppy discs which were discs that I guess were floppy except I don't know if you could bend them that well but I actually don't even remember using floppy discs they're like ancient USBS essentially I don't know they look kind of sick though I'm not going to lie all right this guy thinks he's getting away it's quite cute we're going to be tow hooking okay no we're not I don't understand how how close do you have to be the tow hook just be in a certain range I guess someone over here wants some so it does destroy destroys the wood roll I I think it destroys a brick wall too so you can use it to get in the Box yeah that's crazy I imagine doing any of this oh I nearly just eliminated myself trying to show off that's crazy I suppose one other crazy difference between now and then is also the fact that this setup here doesn't use like as much wires at all like this headset wireless mouse Wireless I think the keyboard can be Wireless but it's just a bit more expensive monitor though not wireless I don't know if they're going to figure that one out for a while um that's going to be pretty hard I reckon uh by the way if you haven't done it already a wireless mouse will change your life like just saying as far as gaming goes it is probably the biggest like upgrade you can do and also wireless headsets are just like such a Vibe as well all right so this guy's tagged 100 so what we're going to do is we going gra over here whoa hey that was meant to be okay it's funny cuz I was like oh I'm going to use my uh tow hook Cannon to get in the box but then I was like why don't I just use the nitro the Nitro is crazy for that too yeah the headset I use is the 900 Max from nonon it's such a good wireless headset obviously would vouch it I don't vouch products that uh I don't believe in myself but yeah you'd actually be surprised the first time I ever went to a wireless headset it actually did change my life as far as playing a game goes now I'm should oh I missed that and now we're just showing off here why am I getting shot [Music] oh what all right it's just too easy we're only on five elims though I still going to get another one I don't know why it doesn't like tow hook me all right you're on there okay it's good but it's just not good enough it's TI on the car oh oh okay another person in a car thinking they run the game yeah pull up pull up pull up pull up okay yeah you got a car oh you're not doing this right now are you oh and you've been eliminated oh here we go unlimited ammo and the boom ball o the lobb's in for it now oh I love it when they think they have a chance what do you think you're doing sorry I don't let you get away like that I got my upgraded Mouse here I don't miss the shots anymore all right let's go get the unlimited Nitro Medallion round off this game will be dying in that car there we go you dying too I guess yeah let's just get in the Box real quick and You're Dead all right this guy over here has got what I want though give it to me we just going to get straight through here oh we can't oh it's the wrong one I shot the wrong guy you even shoot them I'm scared this is the last Real Player all right looks like this guy's in the bunker so let's pay him a visit knock knock who's there see this is hitting him for four damage oh that hit me for more so I can just keep hitting him for four damage making sure just let him know who he's dealing with start annoying him then when we get bored we just do this hello knock knock who's there me then me all right let's get our unlimited Nitro which he had let's get this get Victor out let's just do it all right here we go what are you doing buddy flying [Music] okay well that makes it one oh there you are how'd you get away like that really how did you get away like that that is crazy all right it's time to die buddy you in there no there you are oh no oh no oh no oh I think that might have actually eliminated me as well GG's W's only in the chat look I think it's safe to say that brand new gaming equipment does make a difference I reckon the monitor today that I've played on the 90 setup was doable I reckon that was winnable keyboard also winnable headset wise look we didn't have the great audio that we do have from nonon headsets but I think it was doable but this the mouse this makes the biggest difference uh by far you can't play with a bad Mouse and I'm glad that we've come a long way in the technology for Mouse because that is so much better to play on let me know what you guys thought about each setup Down Below in the comments we'll catch you guys next time peace"

and if I'm being honest it kind of sucked it wasn't my fault I mean at that budget I could only afford the lowest card in nvidia's GTX gaming lineup and I paired it with the lowest chip in amd's ryzen 3000 Series and even with those compromises we ended up blowing the budget and we were stuck running at low to medium settings at 1080p well no not anymore Intel has changed the lowbudget gaming computer scene with the release of their $250 Arc b580 thanks to this GPU right here everything that you guys see on the table is brand new hardware and came to a total of $540 okay okay okay we still broke the budget but we broke it by less and if you're willing to put your trust in some brands that we've never heard of you can get the same performance as us brand new for $500 let's start building but not until after I tell you about our sponsor Greenman gaming they are running their holiday sale until January 10th including big savings like 20% off hell divers 2 74% off Red Dead 2 ultimate sorry you didn't put redemption in there and I got confused Red Dead Redemption 2 Ultimate Edition and even more award-winning games like God of War Ragnarok rock head to the link in the description to find out more about the sale and stick around because we're going to be browsing Green Man Gaming and having you guys help us pick some games to test after we finish our build let's not waste any time and jump right into our CPU of choice I mean at this kind of budget tier I'm using the term Choice a little bit Loosely here let's have a look at the CPU that AMD was willing to give us at a price that we can afford the ryzen 5 5500 see here's the thing AMD doesn't really make new ryzen 3 processors for the retail Market anymore we did find some relatively current ones but they were OEM only and not accessible if you're building your own PC the good news is that by choosing an older ryzen 5 we're still getting pretty good bang for our buck we get six cores 12 threads boost clocks to 4.2 GHz and amds somewhat aging but still quite potent zen3 architecture this cost us $79 and thankfully includes a cooler meaning that we don't have to spend Budget on one later as for our motherboard well I'm going to be completely honest with you guys I'll be finding out in real time if this was a good choice we literally fired up PC part picker and sorted low to high the ASRock a520 M hdv micro was still a whopping 70 dollar how is it that even cheap motherboards are so expensive these days and what are we even getting for features here let's do an unboxing Andy old school unboxing style we get two SATA cables oo an IO Shield oo that's not Halloween why am I doing spooky voice okay we got a manual see no words ah we got an m.2 screw button battery safety notice and we get the board itself I'm expecting this thing to be I actually don't know what I'm expecting am I expecting it to be basic because it's the cheapest motherboard on the market or am I expecting it to be decent because I paid $80 for it no $70 either way oh you know what actually compared to the budget Boards of my younger years not bad oh oh that's hilarious I bumped the table as I was walking around it I managed to snipe my mute button check that out that right there my friends that's that's skill all right so we get actually what looks like probably either a 3+2 or 4+ one phase vrm design uh which makes sense that it would have some what decent vrms on it given that it does have socket am4 and technically is compatible with even some pretty high draw chips uh we don't have really any cooling for it but hey at least it's not one of those boards where it has the through holes for cooling but then just doesn't come with a cooler cuz it's a cost down one so you look at it and you're like clearly the idea was to put cooling on here is that because it needed it or because it was aesthetic hard to say we only get two dim slots but that is pretty normal for a lower-end board and honestly speaking on Modern platforms most of the time I probably wouldn't use all four dim slots anyway we get a couple of pcie slots uh that one is at least full x16 and we get m.2 which is nice to see four SATA ports front USB 3 but no type-c couple USB 2s actually a pretty complete overall package um oh woo IO wow wow you get you get some Modern stuff okay you get a handful of usb3 ports gigabit L uh you know audio jacks but oh man you got some retro stuff on here too to go along with your HDMI you get DVI DVID specifically you get VGA PS2 for that classic keyboard you're rocking and a couple usb2 ports Frankly Speaking not bad like there's nothing here from a gaming standpoint that I'm looking at going oh no I will simply not be able to uh play my games um yeah I'm as long as it runs stably and doesn't have any serious problems with it I think I'm actually okay with this now Elija you did mention that there were some cheaper boards correct we actually found some on New Egg for as low as $43 $43 but they okay there's got to be a reason we didn't choose them let's go ahead and uh let's fire up the old the old uh fresh egg the old not aged you know fertilized and hatched egg it's new I I got it yeah I know I'm just trying to be helpful okay components and storage come on come on over here Andy let's find the cheapest the cheapest am4 motherboard we can I want one that's in stock I want one that's sold by New Egg and I want one that is brand new discount current promotion you what the heck is useful links combo up savings warranty what ises what does warranty mean oh okay oh yeah okay that's cool you can select the warranty thing availability discount dang it where is it I I swear I found this before we started the stream and now I can't find it anymore I want to not refurbished one uh sort by lowest price do you know how to find the I'm pulling it up wait no way Elijah yes sir the cheapest thing they have is $94 now what the heck is going on here seller are you on Canadian or are you on no I'm on do oh that's that is actually not what I was expecting to happen here it's kind of funny cuz remember the brands of those boards were Brands we didn't recognize and we kind of made a joke in script review that they might vanish in a week uh yeah I guess those Brands vanished within the week no there's no way there's no way we're going to find it we're going to find it do you have a link to the boards uh not from those cheap ones no uh show more okay oh my goodness look at some of these Brands there's hoen gagger you see this Andy we got hoen gagger brand we've got Ecom hoer I found a we've got mfh zp K oh hold on I think it's this one I think I got it yep that's the same one dude so it's actually gone up in price it's gone up in price the the uh Juan Jui oh I have Andy Andy help me Juan I don't like no I I can't figure out the T all right well it's $56 now for one of these oh dude that would only save us like 15 bucks Hamburg ERS all right well anyway we're going to see if we can end up under 500 bucks either way let's go ahead and get our CPU installed here uh in case we don't find yeah oh it was $43 before okay for those of you who have never seen how to install an am4 CPU this is going to be a treat so you lift up the arm you do the thing oh yeah there you go got that triangle right there delicious Golden Triangle would you eat golden triangles breakfast cereal oh yeah cuz I think I would I'd be super down for some golden triangles I think that's a pretty I think that's a pretty promising promising cial name uh all right while I get this cooler installed oh my God where did you find this cooler Elijah it was in the stock pile bin it's so dirty is it I grabbed the one that was on top the one you would get would be much cleaner uh yeah see the thing is a lot of our CPUs are either samples from AMD which don't come with coolers or they're just they've been kicking around long enough that we've lost all the packaging and coolers and accessories and all that so this is just a random AMD stock cooler yours would probably look a little different uh Dan I think the script calls for me to do or the plan calls for me to do a merch message right about now yeah sure I've got got any merch messages yet should I explain what they are oh yes merch messages are the way to interact with our live live streams all you got to do is go on LTT store.com we got a lot of great stuff that you can check out there right now uh you can uh back order one of our Precision screwdrivers and bit sets uh you can pick up a regular screwdriver we've got lots of great clothing and apparel t-shirts hoodies all oh oh wait I think the cargo pants are out of stock whatever the point is we've got lots of stuff and just add it to your cart and you'll see a little box to leave a merch message for the stream it'll go to producer Dan who will forward it to me or throw it up on the on the stream or forward it to someone else internally who can answer your question basically he'll get you an answer sometimes his answer is Frankly Speaking not great it's just whatever he can quickly type up when he's going through the flurry of merch messages but hey at least you get something in return you get acknowledgement from Dan and you get your order in the mail which is better than a lot of sort of throw money at the screen streamer things so that's how merch messages has worked and do you want to show them how a curated one works sure hey lde does Intel with their xc2 Graphics potentially make the cut and shift things for NVIDIA HQ to make them change their path I don't know I really don't think so I think that if I'm Nvidia right now I am looking at XE as kind of like a an interesting Sideshow um cuz like all you got to do to figure out where nvidia's priorities lie is is follow the money right so I forget the exact mix right now because I haven't looked at it in a little bit and it's not the kind of thing that keeps me up at night I'm not an Nvidia shareholder but what I can tell you is that there has been a big shift in their revenues between what used to make them a a predominantly gaming oh and also professional visualization company to what they are now which is a predom Min Enterprise uh compute company that has a gaming arm um right now xc2 is not any real threat to Intel's Enterprise Ambitions um and so I just think they're probably looking at this kind of going okay well uh this is a thing that exists and we're aware of I I doubt they're I doubt it's going to I doubt it's going to result any kind of significant shift in strategy at Nvidia with that said with that said Nvidia has gotten to where they are by being ruthless competitors sometimes when it just like doesn't even matter when they could totally just let someone else have a bone they're like no I will have all the meat and all the bones and all the broth and all the vegetables and everyone else can have nothing and that's gotten them to where they are today so you never know with Nvidia they might just ignore Ark treat it as a complete non-threat I mean Intel is currently a ship without a captain even how is how can you take them that seriously um but they also might just go hm someone else got a morsel let's crush them you never can tell with those guys this mounting bracket is stuck and I am doing my best to stall for time while I fix it but I having a very difficult time with it the the arm is stuck too high and it won't come down low enough to grab the to grab the thing Dan do you have another merch message to help me stole with nope oh good oh I just one just came in oh nice wonderful how do you know if you're in love what um what what kind of wait what is that a real merch message that's not you made that up it'll pop up on the screen in a second no way it's from Bradley nobody sent that there it is oh it's real he can't fake that to my knowledge I don't lie how do you know if you're in love well let me put it this way you see that special computer you lock eyes for the the first time she's running Doom maternal actually that's that's a bit of an older a bit of an older game which is fine which is fine it's fine to be into the older computers uh some of them they've uh they've really taken care of themselves and okay sorry this is really this is really coming off the rails here Indiana Indiana Jones in the great circle they uh I don't know I don't know how to answer that question so instead I'm just going to talk about in this cooler it looks like it will require some disassembly so I've pulled out my LT Precision screwdriver that hopefully oh wait do I even need do I even need to do this oh goodness I don't actually know if I need to take out this screw but I'm committed I believe that you just hook over one of them and then throw down the latch on the other side I don't think you have to remove that if you want to put it on the computer uh no no no no though the problem is that this is stuck oh it won't come down so no no I'm well aware of how to install an AMD stock cooler you guy thank you for that though I was there when the AMD stock cooler was written Daniel besser jeez goes on the motherboard yeah thank you for that technically the CPU but so the issue is that I need to get in there I've seen this before where it gets jammed don't forget to put the CPU in first so you guys thought you were tuning into a stream where we were going to be doing a build computer build but instead you're getting the first ever AMD stock cooler tear down on LTT are you kidding me how does this come off I just need to get I just need to get in there uh okay does the fan pop out or what are you even serious right now AMD yep no there's plastic clips that hold the fan in so we're just going to bend those back ever so gently all the while cursing Elijah uh would you like me to get a new cooler out here nope no what I want to do is defeat this one it is now my arch nemesis okay I will give you two minutes before I call J two minutes yes no way well I don't want to drag this on too long Lin no that's what the people came here to see they came here to see Tech tips I'm glad they did but we have other things to shoot today no no no no this is the only thing we're shooting today okay there we go okay so why is it stuck buddy get get it together here okay what are you stuck on oh okay so here's what happened the arm got up too much somehow someone jammed it so it's getting stuck on the fins here see that and this plastic tab right here is preventing it from moving over enough to not be stuck on the fins so what we got to do is we just got to kind of force it a little get oh my God get out of the way wait are you even are you even serious right now buddy oh it's not no no no it's much worse it's much worse so this piece right here you see that is supposed to be in between here and instead it's stuck on one of the fins how did this happen how does this one uncp oh yeah there we go oh I could have taken the whole thing off without I'm doing those screws there we go okay there we go so now we can bend this fin back you following Andy y this can go in between there where it's supposed to be okay so it's got that slide so you can stretch it over the thing this can come back on there we go all right take that stock cooler you just got Tech tipped you're fixed well it's not necessarily fixed yet I could still break these little plastic Clips while I'm putting it back together there we go there we go that is how it's supposed to work supposed to be able to come down in order to fit over the thing all right Dan you got any more merch messages yeah sure I got a couple here hit me how do you think AMD will compete with the 50 Series and the Intel B series dude I don't know the more I look at it and obviously you know I don't know anything about the performance of 50 Series yet um certainly nothing concrete we don't have cards in hand and even if we did I wouldn't be able to tell you anything about them um I don't know anything about amd's upcoming cards other than that I could probably speculate that just like with the um PlayStation 5 Pro we're probably going to see improved upscaling um because AMD and Sony seemed to make it very clear that there was some Next Generation Hardware going on there um so upscaling and Ray tracing I would expect to be very much improved in amd's Next Generation products other than that I don't really know anything concrete about them there is the rumor that AMD is basically not going to bother with the very high end anymore um and they've done that before with some success they've actually done it twice they skipped having high-end cards in their old 3000 Series like Radeon HD 3000 Series so their top end card was the 3870 with that like weird Frankenstein Crossfire card that had two 38 70s on it acting as their Flagship and then they did it again with Polaris so the 500 series uh where the 580 or I think technically they had a 590 but it was basically a 580 so the 580 was their top end card that time um and they managed to they managed to by focusing on just kind of that um that affordable mainstream price point they managed to gain I don't know a little bit of momentum and they came back with high-end cards but then they still haven't managed to kind of keep that momentum so I don't know what to tell you AMD amd's GPU team just hasn't been able to execute the same way that their CPU team has been able to and without being embedded in that team I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly why that is I can just tell you that what I'm observing from the outside is that they're having a heck of a time with it and it's it's honestly kind of frustrating from my perspective because in some ways I don't even I don't even think they're doing like a horrible job right it's not like they don't have competitive products out there it's just they just somehow don't seem to be executing they can't get the sales all right here we go sorry I ah there we go I couldn't reach this screw anymore once that was back on there there we go all right Dan hit me again sure why does LTD store not oh wait no I wasn't done yet never mind I lied um so long story short I suspect strongly that AMD is probably I think we're I think based on the rumors we're probably going to see a repeat of that strategy where they kind of Target a mainstream price point and you know For Better or For Worse we're going to we're going to see how that goes and then as for Intel I think they've I don't think they've given any real indication so far that we're going to see a higher-end Arc so it looks like Intel is going to be gunning for that that value segment that like Esports gamer segment uh as for NVIDIA um I think it's very clear that they're extremely comfortable at the at the top of the roost maybe what we'll see is a future where Nvidia is completely dominant at the top mostly dominant in the mid-range and then AMD and Intel are kind of fighting it out in the value segment which I think would be really good for gamers because you'd effectively have some competition everywhere other than the you know, 1500 to $2,000 cards where I mean realistically if people can afford that then what do they need the competition for anyway apparently they can afford that uh okay are you kidding me I seem to have re broken it all right no no no I will fix it I Dan will give me one more merch message and then I will I will quickly uh I will quickly fim aate it why does LTD store not have Canadian dollars for pricing for fellow Canadian Shoppers Ah that's a good question the reason is that all of our costs are in US dollars so all of our pricing is effectively derived from our costs in US Dollars meaning that if we had pricing in Canadian dollars it would simply be derived from our USD pricing anyway so it doesn't matter so as much as you can kind of look at the pricing and go oh I could totally afford this If Only They priced in Canadian dollars that's not how it works the way it would work is our pricing would just be our pricing in US dollars times the exchange rate to Canadian dollars because our costs are in US dollars so pricing in Canadian the one benefit would be that um there's no exchange rate on the credit card which is that is truly a good benefit um however maintaining an entire set of different storefront um for Canadian dollars when the cold hard truth is that Canadian Shoppers are a small small small fraction of our base is um is not something that our poor accounting department wants to deal with at this current time some someday we may open up multicurrency it is a feature that Shopify enables but it is not a free feature that Shopify enables um I I forget if it's first party or if it's through partners and so it's not um it's not necessarily something that will actually result in lower operating costs or lower pricing because if we're absorbing the cost somewhere either running this feature then it's either that or you absorb the cost in your credit card fee basically every time we've run the numbers it's pretty much come out in the wash and there's not much point in doing it you know what there is a point in doing continuing this bloody PC build our total is now $150 that is more than I would want to spend having only two parts but that's kind of what we're stuck with because modern generation ryzen 3s don't exist anymore so let's move on and talk about our Ram ah yes this was once again determined by low to High pricing with a filter for kits that run at at least 3200 megat transfers per second I got to say guys I'm very excited to install the Silicon power x power turbines we've got two 8 gig sticks which I would consider to be pretty minimal for modern gaming this is one of those situations where in an Ideal World I would actually like very much to be able to put 16 gig stick into a system like this and know that I'm going to upgrade to 32 gigs running in dual Channel later but every time I talk about that these days people get so mad at me so there you go guys there's your two 8 gig sticks running in dual Channel you'll get the full performance today but what it means is if you ever wanted to upgrade from 16 gigs to 32 gigs you're going to have to just Chuck these and put in two 16 gig sticks and I do understand that not running a dual Channel these days is a significant performance penalty um even compared to you know back in the day when many people used to do that just throw in one stick for now and then assume you're going to throw in a second stick later when Ram got cheaper um but I don't know I think personally I would take the compromise especially because like a big part of H I don't know would I because a big part of the reason that we did it back then too was that RAM prices were kind of always going down whereas now they do mostly always go down but they're especially for ddr4 they're kind of already Rock Bottom so there's no like oh it's going to get cheaper later so I can upgrade for a fraction of the price so I don't know maybe that's something where for another you know $19 or what we pay for this thing like 18 bucks or something like that right it was very cheap it was like 21 I think yeah so for another 20 bucks maybe it's worth it to go 56 $60 and just get all the ram you need today now storage this one's going to be a bit of a longer story see we almost went full Intel for this build which would have been kind of hilarious doing a $500 value gaming all Intel build what even timeline am I on um we were thinking maybe we'd use a 1200f CPU but the problem is the cheapest Intel motherboards that we could find from reputable Brands did not support nvme ssds and in present year I just don't feel right putting a SATA SSD into a brand new build if I can avoid it there are situations where SATA ssds make sense say for example if you had already filled your m.2 slot on a motherboard like this yeah by all means add a SATA SSD but if we're talking your boot Drive you're going to want to use an nvme Drive I mean they're priced pretty much the same these days because most of the cost is just the flash itself self so we did avoid using a SATA SSD and we went with this Patriot p300 PCI gen 3 m.2 it's 512 gigs which I mean I consider a great value considering how much Apple would charge for that Ding yeah or whatever anyway Jokes Aside jokes aside I know that 512 gigs is not the most space in the world in fact I would even go as far as to say it's not really ideal like it's enough that you can have some smaller games installed and maybe like one top tier game you know like Final Fantasy 16 you pick that up from Green Man Gaming and then a bunch of smaller games and that's basically all you can do but your mic I it again anyway the point is it's enough that you can at least get started and you can always you know add a hard drive or something like that on one of the for ports later although with that said does this case even have hard drive okay we'll we'll get to the hard drive conversation later for now let's get this SSD installed and I think we're due to check out some stuff on Greenman and let these guys tell us what games we're going to play later absolutely okay cool well let's get the SSD installed real quick here I'm not monitoring chat are people enjoying the stream or yeah seems very very enjoyable right now there's a lot of people on YouTube oh shoot there's a lot of people watching oh yeah that's the thing about streaming earlier in a day yeah there almost there's 18 and a half thousand people watching oh hey what's up YouTube all right there we go boom m.2 installation man it's crazy I never know what the right amount of instruction to give these days is like back in the day we could kind of make the assumption that yeah you know most of our viewers are building a computer for the first time or whatever these days man there could be people that have been watching LTT for 15 years so if I'm sitting here going yeah take your .2 drive and put it in at an angle make sure it's snug put it down two in the screw like those guys are going to get bored but then we also get feedback from people that are building a computer for the first time that are like whoa whoa dude slow down I got no idea what's going on um I almost wonder if there'd be some value to like like creating a for Basics Channel or something like that cuz we we tried to do some some basic stuff on the main Channel back in the day and it just did not fly um the audience like hated that I mean even the more recent how to build a PC last guide you'll ever need those videos bomb out of the gate and then it's not till YouTube's like like recommended or up next and all their various algorithms pick it up that they start to to get anybody watching them all right are we just going on to Green Man gim do you have screen cap like should I go do this over there we can if you'd like I was planning on you just doing it on your laptop you picking three and then we'll do a poll on float plane for chat to pick one I get to pick three yeah so let's look through three games that are available on Green Man okay cool yeah we can do that all right cool so uh Andy yeah I guess I'll just turn this around and we'll hope that I don't get any notifications that are highly confidential by switching my teams to do not disturb there we go I dude okay is it just me but like managing my status on chat apps I can't okay okay it's not just me like I literally can't like I see people that are like they have their status set for their vacation they've got their status set when they go home at the end of the day they got their status set when they're in a meeting they're on a conference call I'm like like guys is it float plane chat is it just me is float plane chat working it is oh a couple people said they agree is it doing the thing oh no I just have to refresh the page okay I'm going to refresh the page cuz I do not have enough brain cycles for that like I have no yeah not just you okay thank you and yes yes I know that you can have automatic ones but that only helps if you happen to be on your meeting in that app like I don't know and I'm sure you could build automations for like your calendar or whatever but I got to tell you with the number of people that have access my calendar my calendar is a disaster like I would be in do not disturb or like in a meeting or in a shoot all the time and I don't even blame the people that that help me with my calendar like I I I get it because a lot of the time the the amount of time that I take to do something is unpredictable like for instance I'm doing a gaming stream where I'm building like a basic computer with like six parts we've been streaming for over half an hour and all I've done is put a cooler on a motherboard and CPU and a ram that's that's like nothing I mean look poor Elijah is dying over here he's dying yeah because his boss is going to be like yo Elijah what the heck why is the stream taking so long don't you don't you make sure that coolers work before you give them to Linus do you have any idea how important Linus is see I I I never have those conversations because I think that's silly I love fixing things but there's there's people there's people that have like performance targets to hit and they're all like Elijah why are you taking so long why why we we need more lus time see you can see is's that to be fair this stream has a very high average viewership right now so I'm good my metrics are hit I'm good do you have metrics for that like uh I don't think for like we're we're basing things off some views and like how videos perform really so I think in the long term we'll see how this stream does as a vaud oh interesting but as of right now this is a there's a lot of people watching so this is good I know so little about how that stuff works these days now that I don't actually have any direct reports um so I just kind of stand here and do my thing I fix coolers uh what am I supposed to be doing right now Green Man Gaming oh Green Man Gaming our sponsor our sponsor Green Man Gaming all right let's go check it out can we brighten the screen yeah I can brighten the screen whatever you want Andy whatever's good for you all right o holiday sale well let's jump right into that obviously right and maybe uh maybe float plane chat can give us some suggestions you guys don't get to pick my three but you can give some suggestions for my three okay I still have never played a god of war game which is extremely embarrassing what kind of game should we play oh dude civ6 is 20 Canadian dollars that's like 154 us or something like that what is this what's what's Anthology is like Anthology like not good or something like what happened if I switch to one of the other ones oh Lordy okay so so what makes it Anthology guys help me out here seven is just around the corner that makes sense yeah but I heard C six is really good I haven't actually played it Anthology includes all the civ6 content released including the game the six DLC Packs oh this is like the whole thing okay I mean that seems like a w right cool what else we got here why is my hotkey not working alt left Arrow hello buddy okay cool did that not go that did not go in the cart okay that's fine we'll add this card here there we go oh now I've got two oh balls I'll take a copy yeah um I I'll figure I'll figure that out later okay what else we got here bunge holiday sale do they even make games other than like Destiny like what what what's in here H we got destiny 2 The Witch Queen Destiny 2 the light and dark Destiny 2 the final shape and annual pass Destiny 2 the final shape Destiny 2 shadowkeep pack Destiny 2 lightfall Destiny 2 Legacy Collection Destiny 2 bunge 30th Anniversary pack Destiny 2 beyond the light pack at this point people did I call it or what like people are thinking this is sponsored by Destiny 2 at this point it's sponsored by Green Man K yeah I'm not even I'm not even buying that okay let's find some let's find some crazy deals game over 75% off M killer seven that's tempting for 10 bucks what else we got what is all this zombie stuff zombies on a plane zombie army 4 is there is are zombies trending right now is are zombies back they never left lonus you suck at parking sounds fun I think I'd be down for this I do kind of suck at parking the world's most extreme parking experience sure sure let's do it let's do it okay you suck at parkings in the cart let's show some more results let's find some deals here boys let's find one more and then we'll get chat to pick between those three civ6 you suck at parking and um you know what I have never played an XCOM game which as someone who loved final Fantasy Tactics and generally loves tactics games um as if anybody ever put an actual real date in here there we go um is sort of embarrassing I should I should probably I should probably have played XCOM so I'm going to I'm going to check out this XCOM collection hello continue does it know I'm lying there's no way oh it's just taking a sec okay all right that's going to be my three that's going to be my three would you like to do a poll we'll do a poll on float plane see which one they pick cuz we won't have time to do all three okay so we should see what maybe let them pick let them pick two okay um also you know what maybe throw God of War in there because I personally kind of want to see like a modern AAA game I'm just I didn't add it to my card on green man cuz I already own it uh let me actually let me make sure let's let me see which God of War I own I bought one at some point cuz I was like okay this is embarrassing I haven't played a god of war game ever and then I just never played it uh so let me see which one I have and then oh my God I don't have how do I not have my own Steam account signed into this computer this is what happens when you are streaming live and you don't there we go all right cool I am now signed in but yeah let's throw let's throw God of War in there and then I'll just buy it from Green Man now if I don't have the right one so you can go ahead and put the poll up all right so on float plane there's a poll top two win God of War civilization 6 you suck at parking or XCOM so everyone on float plane can vote I kind of want to try you suck at parking too I don't know I might just hang around and play games for a bit after I build my computer I mean that's my reward for building a new computer as I get to play games right well we're actually planning a stream uh we're doing a stream oh that's right we are doing a stream we can promote the stream so just like we did back when Intel launched their Arc Alchemist first generation cards where we sat down and we played basically any game you guys asked us to play on Arc to see whether it would work or if there'd be any weird artifacts or anything like that we're going to be doing the same thing again this time with battle mage and we've got some ideas to kind of streamline it so our goal is to get through like double to three times as many games I have no idea if we're going to be able to pull it off because between unskippable loading scenes and actually getting to the point in the game where you take control of the character and like all that kind of stuff there could be some there could be some challenges but we're going to do our best we're going to try Okay so no I only have God of War I don't have God of War Ragnarok so I'm going to go ahead and just add that to my cart real quick on green man thanks again Greenman gaming for sponsoring the stream do I have any like talking points for them or anything like that it's just their holiday sale till January 10th go check it out they're adding more games uh up until that date as as well so keep checking back in you know every other day or so heck yeah okay do I want the digital Deluxe I don't think I care I could just get the regular God of War Ragnarok right I save uh eight bucks okay cool view Card wait which which four did I say I had you wanted God of War civilization 6 you suck at parking and an x-com game oh that's right yeah it was an XCOM Anthology okay that actually looks like a pretty good deal okay that's the one that I'm missing I must not have pressed that all right why don't we continue our build here uh Elijah can you can you check this out yes sir all right thank you there XCOM the ultimate collection that's the one I want looks like you suck at parking and God of War winning right now anyways really that's what chat wants us to play yeah but this is 89% off so I just want to buy it anyway because I don't have any XCOM games Okay okay so if you could do that and here's my wallet yippe thanks see you later well I'm going to buy myself some games now right no okay all right let's move on to our case this is another area where you could probably save some money compared to our build whether that's just getting a case for free from a friend or a computer shop or even a recycling pile or whether that's I mean yeah that's that's that's probably the best way to do it or you could also just pick something up for like five bucks on on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist uh we have had a lot of success over the years getting free cases in fact I don't know if I can think of a scrapyard Wars where when you account for the other value of stuff that we bought like there have definitely been situations where we have exchanged money and gotten a case but I don't think that either Luke or I have ever actually paid for the case as part of that if get what I mean like we were already getting a deal on the hardware itself and by the way there's a case or we get them for free getting a free case is such an like ultimate level hack for getting a better deal on a computer because this case cost us what was it like 40 bucks or something like that 35 bucks okay 35 bucks and it is boy is it ever unexceptional okay and if you think about that 35 bucks even though that's the cheapest case we can find is still about what what does that work out to about seven to eight% of our budget so if we just didn't buy a case that's the equivalent of everything else we buy being on sale you know being 78% off and us being able to get better Hardware elsewhere anyway because the goal of this build was not to you know scrapyard Wars it the goal of this build was to build a brand new computer for around 500 bucks uh we did not go for the secondhand case option but this is a this is one of the big ways that you guys could definitely stretch a dollar uh this by the way no I am not exceptionally strong this case is just exceptionally light this is the DIY PC s08 DG shockingly it has a tempered glass side panel it actually has kind of a pretty looking paint job it's just the um it's just the features and the room to work where it's going to be a little on the lacking side there's also areas were just like I don't know how much money this saved them but it cheaps out in ways that I don't think I have ever seen before check this out check this out so where the io Shield Clips in okay normally you would have like a solid Edge along each side not on the DIY PC s8g no sir here you get a solid piece on that side you get a little tab on the bottom to click it into a little tab on the top you see that little tab Andy okay you get a little tab on the top and then on this side they took four little foldy tabs and you've got those four little foldy tabs to kind of to kind of click it against I don't even think no I don't even think they play a role in holding it into place so you're just using the tabs on the bottom and the side to hold it in as far as I can oh no no they do they do yeah so you just got four little tabs there that hold it into place I mean realistically once the motherboard's in it's not going anywhere but you got this like weird Gap that I have never seen before see this this this Gap right here you see that yeah weird right what [Music] do good tempered glass though doesn't break nice that was close uh it's got um two front USB 2 ports front USB 3 front panel audio apparently it has support for 200 mm radiators I mean other than just being like the cheapest thing I've ever seen it's not bad not bad for features let's see what the build experience is like Elijah did you put in the standoffs that I need correct oh wow what a guy I was actually going to go down memory lane with you lonus you're going to go down memory lane okay well why don't you come over here on camera if you're going to do that do you remember the last time we tried to save money on a PC case I do oh God I brought it with us today oh that's wonderful thank you Elijah truly it is a work of art that we are Unworthy of so yes you can get a PC case for cheaper and it requires some work Dan might actually have some footage from that video that he can throw up on screen here where we butchered the heck out of this case in order to make it fit Modern Hardware oh my goodness not just fit Modern Hardware have adequate cooling for Modern Hardware look at those speed holes look at that fire extinguisher that you're holding cuz it started to smoke when you were using the grinder on it but look yeah isn't it great and to be clear okay not every older case is going to be all solid panels on all sides and require this much TLC to get any Cooling and even if it does hey you can always just take off the side panel and take off the front panel um but realistically even spending what do we spend 35 bucks on this yeah yeah even spending $35 on a case is um going to get you something that's going to look a little nicer and a little more modern I actually am coming around to this thing you know what I Miss though I miss like antech having killer uh case power supply combos like the anex Sonata for instance was just it was awesome because you got a decent enough case you got a quality power supply and it was at a really really attractive price having to buy those parts separately not in a bundle basically as a requirement like I can't think of anyone other than like does like Raid Max or logicist still do case power supply combos I just I can't think of anyone who makes a power supply you would actually want to put in your system that does case power supply combos anymore what what's out there is there anything still I know logist still does logicist still does yeah I don't know about Raid Max though no offense to logicist I would not consider putting a logicist power supply in my computer I'm sorry it's just not really an option this is this is Tech tips not Tech disaster show all right we're doing not bad looking pretty good apparently I'm supposed to do a merch message yeah sure I've got a couple here hit me Dan hey lonus as a darn tough fan have you also had issues with their socks being overly snug and difficult to put on is that something you have found with the upcoming LTT socks any advice oh okay am I rocking the darn tou today oh no I have prototype socks never mind ignore those um I actually consider that a feature not a bug I actually like that long after their first wear because oh man okay I don't want this to get you know you know into like Kinks or anything like that but I can't think of too many things that I like more than putting on a brand new pair of socks like so good the point is the fact that darn top socks stay like tight so when you put them on they're like you know they're they're like it's like a hug for your foot I actually like that I consider that a feature our socks would definitely have uh like a like a like a tighter kind of fit um but there's actually practical reasons for that as well I find that they work almost as like a type of compression sock for me so I um I I wear the like the high ones and I find that when I'm doing sports like whether I'm you know running or playing badminton or whatever else U I used to get shin splint back when I would wear like lower socks or I wouldn't wear tight socks so I find they actually work as a compression sock for me and uh yeah I I consider it a feature um my understanding is that tight socks can help uh help prevent like blood pooling as well so um get used to it would be the best advice that I can that I can give you especially play oh yeah especially especially when traveling yeah Andy Andy is an expert on the dangers of traveling these days and I'm not going to get into any more detail than that because that would involve his personal information which I have not asked him if I can disclose but um yeah compression socks on the plane very good idea now it's time to talk power supply this was probably the most challenging component of this build to choose because pretty much everything else was chosen for us the ark b580 is the only reasonable value GPU at the that we can you know Target this price point point with we went with the cheapest motherboard we went with the cheapest reasonable CPU the cheapest Ram the cheapest SSD then the cheapest case like everything else we were just picking what we can afford for our $500 budget for the power supply you guys can probably already see that we spent a little extra on it we could have gone with a $20 special from someone like logicist or CoolMax um even oh over here even this smart 500 watt from thermal take would have saved us enough that we could have between this and the motherboard gotten down to our $500 budget we could have done that but the thing is Lucas from the lab he's a lot biger than me I mean I I I don't know I think if push came to shove I could probably find somewhere to hide that like he couldn't fit and he couldn't like get to me either way it's not ideal so we were forced to choose something that he approved of and that's why we stretched our budget here and we picked up the minimum that he recommended the Corsair CX 550 wat bronze it's about $60 a lot more than I would want to spend that's about 12% of our total budget but it occasionally goes on sale for about 10 bucks off um there's another thing to note about this it is not the full 600 watts that Intel recommends for this GPU but we talked to Lucas about it and he said that realistically that seems to come down to the arc b580 having somewhat higher transients and as long as you've got a quality 550 wat unit like a passible quality unit it should be fine and that's what we've got here so let's go ahead and get this installed so thank you Lucas and the rest of the lab's team for the hard work that you guys do to make sure that whatever we're recommending even if we're on a tight budget is something that we can stand behind that is not going to fail you um when you're in the middle of a session all right let's get this bad boy installed we got four scre oh I guess I got options right um does this have a filtered intake on the bottom wow you know what for 35 bucks I'm actually kind of liking this case Elijah it's not the world's prettiest filter or anything like that but she's got a a filtered bottom intake and raised feet so even if we're on like a medium pile carpet our power supply is not going to suffocate kind of I'm kind of coming around to this case Elijah right doesn't mean that I want to spend money on a Case when I have a $500 budget it just means that if I have to spend money on a case for my $500 budget I consider this one acceptable you haven't cable managed yet so we'll see that's that's true that is that is true words that you have coming from your mouth um do you have my laptop yeah sorry I was I was hoping to look at floow plane chat but I can't M then sure hey lonus Elijah and sir besser do you still value and use mechanical gadgets like mechanical watches analog cameras or FX Rex over digital ones it's sad to see these industries is fading oh boy man I got to tell you I don't personally have a ton of nostalgia for Analog Devices like I I grew up with a rotary telephone and the second I got a touchtone phone I was like yo this is better and then when I had a touchtone phone with a wire the second I got a 900 MHz cordless I was like yo drop kick boom see you later old phone and then and then when I got a cellular telephone phone I was like no way I don't have to be at home within range of my base station to use this dude progress I love progress dude my first camera I owned was a digital camera that was my first hold on trying to think if there's anything before that no I don't think so my first major expense growing up was I bought myself a digital camera in I think it was grade 10 this is before I bought myself a PC so I loaded my photos from that digital camera my PowerShot a20 so this is like 500 bucks or whatever was a lot of money for me at the time I was I was in high school I I loaded my photos from my PowerShot a20 onto my Pentium I was either a 166 or a 90 or something like that like I I had like an actual crap tier computer it was more important to me to get a digital camera um and I didn't want like I forget what it was even called there was like this weird little like really cheap one that was like you know 144p like weird video thing that I got for a Christmas present and I asked for a gift receipt I took it back I got like $100 credit or something like that towards that poot a20 that was like my first major paid for myself expense and I have never looked back at film and gone wow that would be so much better not once I'm so sorry um I'm just I'm the kind of person that when I'm evaluating something I'm all about okay but how much does it cost me tomorrow like what's my what's my Perot cost with this thing um and it's not like I don't see the value of like developed photos it's it's a lot of fun to go back and look at old scrapbooks and stuff like that I I think that you know Polaroids invite they invite fun you know there's just something about it that is that is fun but I just I I can't get over the the the the calculating part of my brain that goes doll2 $120 $120 and maybe maybe I'm just not a fun person maybe that's what it comes down to because I feel the same way going to like a commercial Paintball Field I'm like nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel you know like I just I I have a really hard time with things that have a continuous cost it's one of the reasons that I love PC gaming so much or at least I used to before everything was gcha um cuz you could buy that game once and get so much value out of it through you know the incredible modding community or through multiplayer and and and always changing experiences and um it's one of the reasons that I just never understood like even when Xbox 360 was like the king and and was incredible I was like I'm sorry sorry it has you you like pay to play online like every month what like I okay I guess see you later yeah I'll get that game eventually anyway and in some cases I was wrong um but in a lot of cases yeah I was uh I was I was less wrong so back to your question film cameras it's not even about the inconvenience of developing the film for me because if anything I think that inconvenience is actually it it can actually be a good thing or like the less inconvenience more ritual right going there getting the putting in the film for development and you know whatever else and it it forces you to do it uh because otherwise there's no way to ever see the pictures whereas with digital you can kind of like quickly look at it on your phone and then you never bother you never get around to it and so in some ways I actually think the convenience of film is sort of Superior in the actual experience of doing it uh because you might actually you might actually follow through and develop something I think printing things is really inconen and that's why almost Nobody Does it um but I just can't get over the the in my mind impracticality of paying um like a significant amount of money for every single shot I take even if it's like out of focus or crappy I like being able to go click click click click click click click and hope that I get a good one I take a lot of my pictures of kids and animals though so like film is especially wasteful when your kids are making stupid faces or whatever else um we actually just shot a short circuit yesterday rounding up uh instant cameras so like Instax Polaroid um uh what's her nuts Kodak has Kodak has one that has like a little built-in printer in it and stuff like that and it's funny because they totally knew Their audience when they prepped the video they prepared like a like a cost per shot for me as part of you know evaluating which ones um which ones I liked I actually co-hosted with yvon as part part of uh promoting Ivon week on float plane where it's going to be I think there's an interview with her uh she does a meet the cats where she shows off all of our cats so we're going to have that uh at lm. floatplane very very shortly sorry I'm just wiring up the front panel stuff I realize I'm just building a computer not actually talking about it here did our 24 pin power connector our four pin power connector up here got our front USB 3 front panel connectors uh all this is this is nice like I remember old budget boards there's no way they would have you know all the connectors silk screened on there so you don't have to look at the manual or anything like that this is actually perfectly acceptably adequate to build in I have no real complaints so far HD audio boom all right that's it our front panel connectors are done would you like to know the two games that won I I would like to know the two games that won yeah hit me it was almost 50% for you suck at parking nice and then God of War God of War so we're going to have to get this built cuz we're going to have to make sure those are installed because I didn't know that those were the two that we're going to win so well uh you could start uh downloading God of War now right possibly I onto a game drive you have do you have a game Drive no oh all right cool now for the moment we've all been waiting for the reason that we are able to make a kickass gaming computer for a console like price the Intel Arc b580 if you guys haven't seen our full review view of this card it is a mustat but the tldr is that it's out for as little as $250 and in our suite of games it was able to handle 1080p ultra settings and never drop its average FPS below 60 to say that this is the type of game-changing disruptive GPU that the entry gaming Market needed would be a gross understatement the fact that we're even calling $250 entry level is such a mind mindblowing thing to me it says so much about the way that Nvidia and AMD have abandoned budget Gamers like you used to be able to get something not garbage from Nvidia and ATI for like a hundred bucks in change nowadays cards for $110 actually you know what this is worth this is worth pausing not talking about Arc for a second and firing up New Egg again check this out you guys we did this as part of the uh as part of the prep for the video okay here I'll just throw this on on the ground okay components and storage GPU and graphics card devices okay check this out gaming video cards here we go sort by lowest price okay let's take out refurbished let's see if I can find the refurbished tag this time condition here we go maybe this is where I was able to find it new all right oh this is actually not that bad okay you can get a 6500 XT hey where was that where was that stupid junk from Nvidia that we well we haven't seen anything from Nvidia so let's see let's see what we can find from Nvidia we're all the way up to $170 we haven't found a single Nvidia card yet here you go you can find some okay how is this new are they still selling 3050s this has one egg I'm not even sure if I believe that we're all the way up to 100 $80 so apparently we have to change our filter to components and storage just gpus what's up I have this one yeah there you go this is a 1030 if you want an Nvidia card for like a 100 bucks in change you are literally getting what is this like a seven-year-old GPU or six-year-old GPU or something like that the architecture was 8 years old I believe an 8-year-old architecture like guys this design is older than my youngest child pretty much only suitable for outputting a secondary display AMD a little bit better but this 1080p ultimate 1080p did I say ultimate I meant Ultra the point is it's got 202 generation battle mage XE course 20 R tracing units clock speeds of up to 26 70 MHz and a total board power of 190 Watts not to mention that they gave a huge huge Fu to the incumbents by equipping it with 12 gigs of vram for those of you who are out of the loop that's a really big deal and the conversation's been going on for a little while but obviously it hasn't been going on enough to reach nvidia's ear back when they released the 4060 there was a lot of conversation around the $200 pay wall that they put in front of getting more than eight gigs of RAM because at uh I believe it was 3.99 you could get the 4060 with 8 gigs at$ 4.99 you could get the 4060 TI but still with 8 gigs of RAM and you had to go all the way up to 5.99 to get the 460 TI 16 gig which was functionally pretty much the same thing as the regular TI but just with a modern amount of vram on it and there was no 4060 16 gig so they had a 460 starting at $400 but if you wanted something that was going to be able to keep up in modern games you had to spend $600 which is more than this entire computer even after we blew our budget now In fairness those cards have come down a little bit but anyone who invested in them got a really awful value uh we predicted and many predicted at the time that not having 16 gigs or at least more than 8 gigs of vram was going to be a problem very soon and it turns out that we are very soon o'clock later and it's already a problem Indiana Jones in the great circle has a clear performance penalty from using an 8 gig card and it's only been what has it been like a year and a half since the 4060 came out I'm trying to remember what the actual uh what the actual timeline is Elijah do you mind checking the release date of the 4060 series for me real quick thank you so much in the meantime I'm going to look for a 632k screw here it looks like it was is June 2023 era oh my yeah so a year and a half ago oh man I'm good nice nailed it go lus anyway the point is uh it has issues with 8 gig cards and that is in spite of it being an Nvidia sponsored title so you go and you buy one of nvidia's basic you know raid tracing ready cards or whatever and you're going to have issues with a game that comes out just a year and a half later anyway we've got our Arc battle mage in here let's go ahead and get this plugged in here we go and a Boop and that's it that my friends is how you build a PC now this is not a perfect PC in fact I would say that it's a pretty safe bet that um we would need to add at least I'd say an intake fan here I'd say once we've got an intake fan on the front to use this vent draw some fresh air across our GPU this exhaust and that intake working together is probably enough but worst case scenario we are on a tight budget we have 500 bucks to spend we can always add a fan later and we can run our side panel off until our you know our next lawn mowing session or you know whatever it takes for us to get like you know eight bucks for a fan off of teamu or whatever um Elijah do you want to grab a monitor and let's uh let's get this thing going oh I guess I should do a little bit of cable management first do you mind grabbing a couple zip ties real quick I okay in the meantime Dan do you want to hit me with merch message yeah sure um doing a bit laggy on the stream here hold on let me just pause this um hi de restocking my gift card stockpile after the holiday buying have you ever got refused tech support because of uh so-called incompatible Hardware like having GeForce not Quadro oh oh oh I mean we ran into something like this very recently I don't know about refused tech support but we've definitely been told yeah there's there's nothing we can do for you you've got the wrong thing in situations where I don't personally feel that that makes a lot of sense we talked about this when we were looking at that uh that spatial lab's uh stereoscopic 3D monitor that uh that Acer co- developed and they have a commercial version of it that for whatever reason is locked from running games like you you you can't you you I I understand okay yeah fine I can't run the commercial stuff on the the gaming version of it no problem but why on Earth would you tell me that I'm not allowed to game on my like like professional grade one who are you to tell me I'm not allowed to play video games on this thing when it costs so much more like the one that costs more should just it should be everything that the cheaper one is and more not just I'm not going to go buy another one to play video games um so I thought that was I thought that was pretty bananas that one was pretty recent I'm trying to think of anything personally though and nothing really Springs to mind for me Elijah have you ever run into anything like that sorry I missed the merch message sorry you bought the wrong you bought the wrong product I can't I can't help you with that and their example was something like you know running GeForce drivers on Quadro just like artificial software lockdowns I I feel like I probably have had a story when I used to do it support like I reached out to the company that made the software that the company I was dealing with was having issues and they're like you're using unsupported hardware and I'm like your your specification was Windows 7 or newer so like what do you mean I'm using unsupported hardware and they were like well it's Windows 11 and I was like well that's newer but it's like oh it hasn't been verified yet and it was like I had those examples when Windows 11 was just rolling out and we were deploying it on sites but I've definitely run into into um oh dude actually that reminds me yeah I've run into quite a few where they won't install because you have the wrong version of Windows uh but it like totally doesn't matter and once you force it to install it totally works yeah uh I hate that just try to install and if it doesn't work or whatever you can tell me it's unsupported during the installer but do not outright block me from installing it that's just that's just wasting my time that's all you're that's literally all you're doing is wasting my time cuz I'm going to figure out I'm going to go find the file and I'm going to go you know fill in the versions of Windows that you support or whatever I'm just going to I'm going to go fix it anyway so all you're doing is making me do that which I don't like to do the worst part was doing tech support for companies that are using older Hardware whether it was like a specific CAD license or something that like only worked on XP yeah and then obviously I can't phone the company and be like hey I want this to work on Windows 11 so I have to like figure it out I have to fight through either registry or other setting changes to get it to work because my client that we're serving refuses to change to anything newer which is fair you know what and valid in some cases especially with stuff like CAD software it's super valid yeah like that machine just the panel by the way prove it okay anyways that machine just worked works and their technicians like they're they they they don't they don't care oh yeah they don't care about Windows or whatever they just need to get their job done no I get it man I get it I mean I think a lot of the time our crowd right forgets that for a lot of people a computer is not fun it is not a toy it is just a tool it is just like their pair of pliers it is just like their you know work smok it is it is nothing but a tool to a means to an end um and for folks like that yeah I get it you don't want to just like go upgrading software and oh and in a lot of cases one of the reasons that they're locked into that older version of the software is not because a new one doesn't exist or that the new one doesn't have features they'd like to use but because the new one has switched to a subscription model that was the biggest complaint always I'm not paying for the new version because I own this one and this one does everything I needed to do yeah so why but they get a pop up every four minutes or every time they boot it hey have you considered subscribing to the new one you'll get all these fancy features yeah I have considered it yeah the answer is no no um where' that spritzer bottle that you had go there's one behind the arc if that's what you're talking about yeah well I didn't really want ISO but this will work okay well yeah I just want I want a nice clean side panel I want her to look her best you know that's fair nice clean looking her best side panel for 500 bucks hey 500 bucks dude it is so exciting for me to be able to build a $500 computer again yeah like this used to be my job uh back when I worked at NC I was in charge of like the PC configurations so I would I would you know go and I would try and come up with creative ways to save a dollar here and there and like try to build the best thing that I can for the money um did we lose uh grommet from the side panel maybe when you it was already gone when I grabbed it from inventory oh got it okay so it's not our fault we didn't buy this brand new for the stream we're sorry guys but we already had it in inventory and it happened to be $35 so it matched our criteria got it makes sense mhm all right let's pop this bad boy on here oh yeah oh wait oh she's uh she's not symmetrical which is fine I can work with this there we go I was going to say is it cuz you dropped it did it Bend no Elijah all right uh Dan want to hit me sure we we've seen quite a few of wacky fan configurations from Alex and the team but when are you guys going to power a whole PC with the back feeding from spinning PC fans with an air compressor oh uh wow what would that even look like so we'd have to get some kind of fixed voltage out of the fans which means we'd have have to spin them all at kind of like the same speed we'd have to from there oh my God that would be I don't know if we're going to do that yeah yeah I don't know I don't know if we're going to do that the answer is never yeah that's it's a cool idea but I think it's the kind of cool idea that as long as Alex doesn't watch the stream we're never going to have to do I'll the time stamp dude 500 bucks okay 540 but we could have cheaped out on our motherboard cheaped out on our power supply $500 class cuz we spent what four 540 bucks right yeah uh yes it came out to 540 total freaking awesome yeah what card did you use I just realized I gave my personal card to Vance for I grabbed the first one that was in there oh no wait what this one I grabbed the one that looked like a bank card this one here yeah Ivonne is going to kill me that's a USD card the transaction was in CAD I didn't well do I spoil it that I didn't actually purchase with the card because we already have the games on our account oh I just did that for the fun of it cuz you gave me the card and I was like okay well I'm not going to actually I was going to buy the cards I was just going to put them on my account oh okay well you're good I didn't say buy the cards I me buy the games okay I didn't actually spend any money oh I took it off camera cuz I was like oh it's probably just for the bit I was like like haha buy the games and I was like well I'm not going to actually dig through his wallet no I was I was I I don't fake things on camera I want to play those games well I'm not I'm not saying you don't want the games I just did you gave me your credit card and I'm like I don't feel comfortable typing this in stop staring at me awkwardly stop just you're the one who's awkward all right bucko bucko I don't know man I I don't see I don't I don't think it's a big deal oh hey we don't have a desk pad oh we do have our modmat though this is coming this is going to be available on the store like next year right or I don't know if signups are ready yet but this is coming out about mid January signups are are up oh okay so then signups for the modmat are up I don't know if this is the actual final version uh but it looks pretty close it's really close mod mat's freaking awesome I'm extremely proud of the team it is class leading in every way price quality I I believe the value of the information that's on it for like a typical PC Builder uh really really excited about this thing we worked with the um uh we we worked with the creator of the patented modmat uh mod right uh in order to bring this to Market so everything's kind of buttoned up there really really excited and like way more affordable than a lot of the other options that are out there right now pretty cool all righty I still wouldn't recommend at a $500 PC budget blowing money on a on a modmat to build it but especially as you're getting up into sort of higher prices where that would not be a huge amount of your budget and wouldn't really cost you a significant amount of performance it's not a bad idea and comes with an anti-static wrist strap and all that as well of course wow the stream latency is really low these days did they uh did they decrease the stream latency on float plane I have no idea probably maybe like check this out that's just like a few seconds that's really good great job guys thank you cool all right what do you think Elijah oh no I whammied it oh we closed the side panel I closed the side panel oh we're going to be here for 3 hours there's absolutely no shot that this thing powers on on the first go wait wait if we reopen the side if we reopen the side no that doesn't count he's already ruined it it doesn't count once you close the side panel you have jinxed it officially sorry James yeah we really did try to get this done in a reasonable amount of time that's okay these guys like hanging out with us anyway why isn't he pluging in Dan hit me with a merch message sure what are you doing the power cable's not plugging in can I see yes sir go ahead Dan has any discussion happened on bringing back the Black Shaft for the Original Gangster screwdriver now that the Precision has proven itself mine was stolen recently and I love the black finish compared to Silver um this is not for this monitor it was with the monitor that's why I I I can't I don't know what to tell you they don't go together um if we can find a treatment that is black enough and strong enough and durable enough and all the things that we need um we would love to do a Black Shaft screwdriver but we haven't yet um and I wouldn't say that the Precision is necessarily um just just because we've done a black Precision driver doesn't mean that we would do a black shafted regular screwdriver there's a couple reasons for that one is that the Precision driver is not the kind of thing that we expect people to just Huck in their tool bag and you know get you know beat up um and we expect it to kind of live in a case whether it's ours or one from I fix it or someone like that uh we expect it to kind of be cared for a bit more and mostly just hang out in your hands or on your desk on your project mat or whatever uh number two is that the screwdriver is not even made of this screwdriver is not made of the same material this is anodized aluminum so anodizing is an excellent high durability finish it's still going to chip occasionally if you know you ding it on something or whatever you can see I got a little one in M but because it actually transforms the top layer of the aluminum it's it's really really really strong um our shaft on the screwdriver is stainless steel it's not an it's not anodized can you anodize steel either way it's definitely a different process and we have not found that it is good enough why don't you just like make it out of bers or something uh we are not exploring EX materials for screwdriver shafts anytime soon we've had enough nightmares with bad screwdriver shafts all right let's fire this thing up do you get it you ready black metal is it going to work here we go a fan is spinning yeah that's a good sign got that RGB man AMD and Intel better together you know what's crazy five years ago those would have been swapped I know right yeah wow you went really high end on the uh monitor Elijah the power cable is not on the Shelf there so I just grabbed the next monitor okay well that's quite the monitor we've got like a QD OLED what looks like I think this is the 14 is this the 4K why what the heck D I think it is the is this the 4K 240 HZ yeah are you are you high sorry I don't think I'm allowed to ask you that I don't think I can answer that why don't look at my [Laughter] eyes all right down want to hit me with another message we lost your mic did I really do that again hey it booted though okay hit me oh hey hey hey hey look that that's good that's good that's what we want uh Dan do you want to hit me with another merch message while I reboot this thing so that I can actually dial in the ram timings sure has uh sorry no we already did that one greetings from Colorado lonus what do you think about 3D movies watch through a VR headset and the complete lack of services to watch 3D movies nowadays any thoughts on on completely VR movies oo okay I haven't tried Apple's VR Movie experience thing whatever it's called where you're on the submarine I really want to but after the review of the Apple Vision Pro I brought it back to work and then I've never touched it again um i' I've been meaning to grab it and bring it home and try that just cuz I what it called submerged or something like that I think anyway I want to try it it sounds super cool I don't have an opinion until I actually try it but what from what I've heard it is super cool as for watching 3D movies in VR awesome I mean that is where you're going to get the best possible display um but for me it's the same thing again that I brought up in my review of the Apple Vision Pro where here hello yeah I'll do the windows thing okay yes sir or not I was I was going to help you like yeah just hold shift when restarting yeah um what was I saying 3D movies yeah 3D movies so it's the same thing that I brought up in the review of the Apple Vision Pro right where it's the best way to watch big screen content as long as you're watching it by yourself and for a lot of people that's appealing for me it's not I almost never oh damn it I missed it one more time I almost never watch a movie by myself um especially not oh I'm trying to remember UI UI there we go okay trying to remember like if I'm just like watching something on my phone I will um or if like I'm watching something at the gym I will but those are not things that I'm I have a VR headset on for like if I'm at the gym I am at the gym I'm not wearing a VR headset and if I'm you if I'm watching something on my phone it's because I'm in the bath or I'm like otherwise not able to be like bolted into something so VR headsets they just don't really they don't really have a place in my daily life other than beats saer just exercise unfortunately I I love VR it's I I love immersive experiences I think it's super cool I'm so so so ready for a replacement to the index actually I got to try the I got to try the big screen Beyond with their audio strap I still haven't done that let me know how it is I've been meaning to also we have one of those VAR or whatever we have one of those vario headsets that I really want to try too all right what do you think we're going to are we going to get uh dop or XMP or whatever where the heck do you even where do you even control that stuff here overclock mode bus speed Auto manual oh here we go XMP settings boom 3200 think it's going to work uh I think it's going to work okay I believe we're going straight to 3200 no problems I mean realistically it does come down to board layout and Trace design to an extent but it also comes out comes down in a big way to the integrated memory controller on your CPU and as far as I can tell AMD doesn't just you know put their the crappiest possible memory controllers on their entry level chips all right do we have Steam on it steam should be installed okay here we go do we have a mouse pad by any chance cuz as much as I love the modmat it is not a mouse pad I mean I have a big one I don't have although this is convenient if we' used a modmat as our mouse pad back in the day when we forgot to remove those feed off of that mouse in a short circuit and we would have found them cuz I just moved it once and it removed the feet covers from this MSI Mouse that's a feature all right let's I do not have an internet connection so we're going to have to sort that out we're going to need oh are there not what happened to the C Oh no I got it I got it I got it it was so managed by our magnetic Cable Management that I couldn't see it let's go I can't believe that this compter computer booted up I expected it to be whammied we downloaded those two games on the Z Drive can I help you guys yeah do you have the oh thing managed uhor I'll let I'll let you do it I'm going to come over here and I'm going to be Dan I'm going to be producer Dan into a merch message hey Lexus I'm starting a new oh wait is his mic on Dan is your mic on am I in two mics yep oh and he's not going to fix it for me wow what a guy realized the problem yeah maybe the other way around nice Hi Alexis I'm starting a new water cooled build do you think it's possible to flood the loop with an inert gas that is denser than air before I fill the loop so that I can avoid bacterial buildup hi Mason B you are overthinking it you just need to put a little bit of bioside in your Loop once you fill it and that is going to take get you right sorted out it's not going to affect performance and as cool as it is to like put inert gas in your Loop or whatever um yeah you you really really really really don't need to do that um I mean if you do make a video about it like that sounds fire but uh yeah you don't have to Matthew M says I was considering using magnetic Cable Management power brick holders to mount some external hard hard drives under my desk but given the powerful magnets I was kind of curious good idea or bad idea you would actually be very surprised oh metal Maxine and float plane chat says argon cooled PC okay I have actually wanted for quite some time to see what happens if you cool a PC with some other gas like like a denser gas can you like carry the heat away from a heat sink faster like it I don't know I don't know it's it's something I've wanted to experiment with for a long time someday someday we'll do it but but not yet um what was I talking about again uhoh I think I lost it right you would be very surprised how powerful of a magnet you need to have any kind of impact on a hard drive like I even hard drive manufacturers are having a hard time controlling flipping the bits and they have to use like heat assisted recording in some of the highest end drives now and some of their most dense drives um Ty in actually did a really good short on the LTT Channel where he showed that unless you get into absolutely ridiculous territory a magnet is not going to do anything to your hard drive so I would say you definitely can um but I would question the need to do that because if your if your drive is sort of permanently enough there that you need to like cable manage it into your setup maybe it would be better to just install it as an internal drive there is a performance advantage to doing that over USB um look at yeah tinan says it'll stop the motor if it's too close yes but if it's in an external hard drive enclosure it shouldn't he doesn't recommend mounting hard drives with MCM okay there you go tinan has spoken in chat but I sincerely doubt I sincerely doubt that in an external enclosure you would manage to get it close enough to cause a problem but take that for what it is he says don't do it so we don't recommend it officially there you go what else we got archive wait no way I Timothy M says do you ever miss the old days in the garage and staying in my basement Timmy okay that's less weird than it sounds if you have the full context because there was a year that we went down to I think it was PS and we did stay in Timmy's basement it was it was voluntary like we were not held there against our will but but we did in fact we did in fact stay in Timmy's basement uh it saved us uh it saved us a hotel cost which was good and we got to hang out with Timmy tech TV which was also good and yeah I actually had our our Christmas dinner our first ever annual Christmas dinner for smash Champs last night and between the full-tim and part-timers I think we're up to about 17 people 15 of which attended the Christmas dinner and it was it was pretty it was pretty fun it was it was different lmg has gotten bigger in all the ways that are good and in all the ways that are not as good um you know we have to be uh it's it's it's a more corporate Vibe things are a little more controlled they're a little more structured they're not really off the cuff anymore and there's definitely really good things about that from like uh you know liability and insurance and and you know HR streamlining and you know all these things perspective but uh there are things that are more fun about working with a really small team and it was it was fun it was it was fun kind of hanging out with the smash Champs team even though I I only really know a handful of them like some of them are pretty some of them are really new like everyone's pretty new I mean it only opened a few months ago uh but some of them are especially new like some have been kind of working behind the scenes in the leadup to the launch so I've and and I knew them before hiring them so so those folks it's uh it's a little more natural just like hanging out with but yeah everyone else is pretty cool too archive man these are these are coming in pretty fast here getting the merch M are you you guys doing okay over there yeah ragnaroks just having a little bit of an issue booting we're getting an error code that we're just trying to resolve right now okay Ragnarok won't start from the nas so it might have to install it locally but it's 175 gigs oh wow uh it oh man at that point would it be faster to go get a higher speed Nick and install it and then copy it I think it might just got the steam Drive oh yeah okay yeah steam drive and know where it is no one knows where the steam Drive is oh good hey professional Tech Media company don't worry we got this what was I going to say oh yeah do we have resizable bar installed while he's going and doing that do you want to make sure rebar is enabled in the Bios it should be by default on a modern board like that but we should double check CU Arc will not perform its best without resizable bar all right what else we got here Brandon s says I'm sure you couldn't make a whole episode about it but if you could take an excuse to look at Wheelchairs and hearing aid teex someday it'd be validating to see someone talk about how old the tech is yeah the fact that the fact that it's been so obvious for so long that Apple was gunning for hearing the hearing aid Market the the the accessibility market and the incumbents have as far as I can tell effectively done nothing to prevent them from coming in and completely disrupting their industry is flipping wild to me it shows how something can be as mainstream as apple I want to make sure it's enabled and you can still have an entire industry being like nothing is going to happen we can just keep charging insane amounts of money for ancient technology everything should be fine like absolutely wild to me um as for wheelchairs I got to be honest with you I don't know enough about it but I do know that that's something that Jerry rig everything talks about a fair bit and has done some really cool stuff in the space that's realistically the most that I know about it um the only reason I know anything about hearing aids is just cuz I have a family member who is uh who's heart of hearing and who uh worked in a school for the deaf so I know a little bit of sign language I know a little bit about um I know a little bit about the culture but I'm always hesitant to I know enough about these communities to know that coming in as an outsider and talking about it is not necessarily something that I should be doing and while some people might be chill with it and appreciate the spotlight others would really prer that I yield that Spotlight to you know um members of that community so it's a it's a tricky it's a tricky thing and I we we have looked at some for example accessible controllers and stuff in the past but it's not something that I like to dive into too much um pug boy says airpods don't compete with the concealed style of modern hearing aids though and that's fair enough but with the number of people that I see just walking around wearing airpods I'd say say having airpods in your ears is as stealthy as just about anything like I don't know I don't know just saying just saying um but I can totally understand that everyone has very different feelings and you know what works for them works for them and my perspective on this is obviously Limited at best thank you all right archive that we don't Anonymous asks I was looking at those little 3D printed CPU clam shells that you guys use where do you get them I thought they looked 3D printed if so have you released the St STL file or do you plan on releasing the STL file we absolutely plan to release the STL files for all the cool little things that we have created internally to make our lives a little bit easier it has taken some time for us to get that off the ground for reasons that I'm sure make sense to the people who are working on it but I do not fully understand um it's been a little frustrating to me that it has taken so long for us to release this stuff but I have been assured that in the next weeks not months we're going to have our repository up with some of the cool little stuff that we have like we have for example for our magnetic Cable Management um power power bar key holder one we have uh we have one that takes one of those on one side and then hold a screwdriver on the other side we've got uh man I don't know we have so much stuff we have like little stacking things that hold screwdrivers I think we've got we we've got a ton of stuff including those those little CPU holders and we want to put it all in a repository for people to use um hi there says yron I just found out my Black Friday package got processed in Germany yesterday but I'm in China how much chance I will have it before Chinese New Year I'm going to be honest with youon I have no idea I cannot IM imagine why it would have been more practical for them to go all the way across North America all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then well into Europe to route to China anyone in chat like is that a is that a Thing versus just going over the Pacific like I my best guess is that it just has to do with like capacity and you know how much capacity there is on the cargo planes and and that's how they're picking that's how they're picking the route versus you know the the shortest possible distance um draiss says that Germany is the major shipping hub and I'm like okay like that's cool um but yeah Anna maxtor says my package is headed to Peru and is also in Germany okay sure I have never been in China and ordered something from North America before so shut up dig TF says say I've ordered on LT store before I live in New Zealand and that goes through Germany as well and that's just what because DHL is German too far gone says they live in New Zealand theirs didn't so it seems to just come down to whatever makes the most sense to them with their logic H good job everybody cool same for India apparently says Joshua all right cool wolf West says I think it's due to DHL doing that to save money I someday someday I will work in the shipping and Logistics industry and I will learn how that helps save money um shipping things halfway around the world before sending them back the other Halfway Around the World in the other direction but now I do I have not done that and I do not know so I have no insight to share with you how's that going over there good we're lumping in Ragnarok some bringing a game drive over but we could play the other games if you want let's do that we can do parking let's do it let's play you suck at parking Linus all right I assume this is a controller game do we have any controllers handy trick question David has a whole wall of controllers over there so why don't we um grabbing one really quick thank you so much appreciate you did I just hit the mute button again I didn't oh good uh metal Maxine says Dan has an international Logistics degree I think is that true Dan yeah okay can you explain why everything routes through Germany instead of going like maybe on a direct path uh let me just mute this mic uh probably because of like the standard distribution hubs right if I am always sending planes to one place just go to that one place instead of going somewhere else right if there's no direct connection kind of frustrating you think from like West Coast North America to China like it's China You' think that you'd have the Hub there why wouldn't you I mean like most FedEx I believe goes through is it is it Memphis like every single FedEx plane goes to their Hub they do all their maintenance everything like that okay okay plain maintenance sure I don't I don't remember where UPS is is that Detroit I feel like this is the kind of thing that like AI would actually be perfect for helping with I mean they're probably using it already I I I just mean if you were to if you were to have you know more hubs yeah then you could kind of help to solve for you know what's the most efficient way to have it go do some stuff and then end up back at the main Depot for maintenance or whatever I don't know but sure there you have it it's more cost effective apparently to just have your main hubs and then have everybody you know who is an expert at doing whatever of the crap it is that they're doing there and sure okay oh cool hey we've got the Nixie npo1 let's go press right trigger to accelerate let's play some you suck at parking I am I am stoked stoked to try this oh uh I'm also stoked on the fact that I'm getting a casual 380 frames per second on my $500 gaming PC now obviously this is not the world's heaviest game by any stretch of the imagination I've also set the monitor to 240 and I think it's is it 4K but we're running at 4K let's go it might be worth getting the verification for Ragnarok going while I've already started installing it oh okay all right grass and snow are on let's go do you want to get a closeup of my 370 FPS that people don't believe me let's go let's get a closer closeup closer closeup 380 $500 gaming PC sick all right right trigger to accelerate okay oh okay left trigger to break stopping is parking there is no reverse are you kidding me okay so I just need to like nail this boom now park on all spots you can steer oh oh you already parked here find a different way I know I can steer whoa let's go woohoo okay did that count I think that counted oh this is fun dude the driving physics in this game are so fun oh you can't reverse right that makes sense dude it's just drift Central I love it how have I never heard of this probably because you only play CS I don't play CS oh no oh keep pract oh yeah okay skip tutorial let's go welcome to you second parking have fun parkster oh I don't think I'm going to be playing online what's campaign Inferno drive around find landmarks to Play Levels or in parking spots to unlock new islands okay oh my God you can go off the edge that that makes sense that seems like the kind of thing at Elder Hut okay let it Sizzle carue well this is fun Jan says this game looks so fun hey did I mention that we got it from our sponsor for today's video Green Man Gaming do I have any more talking points for them or anything Elijah or not really man they just have a sick a sick sale you know they got a oh no oh my God I'm on fire my car is on fire what what happens I die I mean yeah kind of checks out um logically speaking oh oh oh okay uh I think I follow okay that counted apparently okay boom dude this is so fun I kind of love it okay so this time I do not take the first oh no oh oh oh jeez okay dude please tell me they have like competitive modes and stuff oh oh my God no not that I should be competing in them oh what do you mean this is just like you driving IRL right I think I am better at parking than this in real life okay I just need to take this wide yeah there we go oh let's go oh my God this jump okay sure oh it's got the oh shoot and a casual 390 frames per second right now oh well that doesn't work very well and we're in motion 540 oh yeah that was that was not a fair comparison though he was in the middle of nowhere dude this is fun oh come on okay it's sort of fun it's the kind of like frustrating fun that uh you know some people are into masochists Dan probably okay we're just going to take it a little slower here we're gonna okay we're going to take it a little slower what no no yes okay I got the second one and then yeah there's a third one still okay I can do this I can do this boom wait I only have 15 seconds I didn't even realize that each attempt was time wait I'm down to oh no you have a fixed amount of time time total to do all of them I only have 6 seconds left I can't make it I can't make it Dan no last car last car oh my God I can still make it I just have to be perfect in every oh my god well out of fuel what do you mean out of fuel either way hold on how quiet is this machine Andy stock pretty quiet oh good timing for train pretty loud yeah dude this thing's quiet I love this computer do we have uh do we have Hardware info on here uh maybe okay uh if we don't I'm going to get it real quick so then when we play our next game yeah see how uh Ragnarok is doing as well hopefully go okay yeah yeah yeah should be about 10 minutes or something uh it's at 3% did you guys configure it to allow transfers to continue well gaming probably not I think like that by default okay maybe it might be on this drive as well oh okay so you can just add this drive as a uh game Drive really quick okay well I'm allowing okay let's have a look common got of War Ragnarok let's go storage at Drive boom here we go this is going to be great now we're gaming boys oh we might have we might have bunged it we might have bunged it no you're good did you add it as a destination hold on hold on hold on I'm going to un I'm going to unbind that one game Drive d uh remove Library yes okay then I'm going to manage and uninstall God of War Ragnarok that i' I've run into this before where you're like downloading it to one of your game libraries and then you like plug in one that has it and then you go to launch it and it's like has no idea what to do you don't you don't want it it's a bad time all right let's throw the other game drive back on there boom and God of War Ragnarok is ready to go okay before before we do that though let's go ahead and grab our portable copy of Hardware info which is a super super awesome Hardware monitoring program and I want to see what kind of temps we're getting on our CPU and GPU in spite of the fact that we have functionally no case airf flow we just have the one rear fan which In fairness is all we can really expect for a $35 case but um it's not necessarily ideal for having your Hardware running as nicely as possible all right CPU which one do we want sure we'll take um T die Okay so we've got a little graph for our CPU now let's go grab a little graph for our GPU GPU core temperature GPU Global oh the current maximum temperature okay so that'll be our hot spot probably okay let's grab our hot spot and our core attemp for the GPU oh shoot I always I always do that a and of course it's a web search because why wouldn't it be a web search thanks Microsoft I always do that I uh specifically removed the ability to do that on your when laptops oh fud what sorry what ability did you remove from my w laptop they be able to the ability to web search from the start menu oh really yeah this computer and the other one too yeah I hate it we should do a we should do just like a like a Windows modding guide D Windows Windows yeah like it'd be probably a great little float plane exclusive no no I think that could be a Mainline video Elijah do you mind do you mind adding that to the next writers meeting we'll do just like little tweaks like that we do like 10 Windows tips to make window better um there's some there's some really good stuff like better indexing for um uh for Network folder shares and stuff like that so you don't have to wait around for forever to the writer meeting yeah handful handful of stuff like that would be really cool okay okay God of War Ragnarok let's go oh I guess I'll be using my controller again probably casual yeah I'm not you're not gonna play God of War with mouse keyboard I know I know jeez casual this guy oh what's updating okay comment R okay do you want to hit me with the merch message in the meantime then yeah sure I think I've got one left here true lonus could you showcase the commuter backpack and would it come with the big locking carabin or like the LTD backpack loved it but sadly lost it you oh you lost your original oh dude it's so big how'd you lose it no just kidding I'm just making fun of our gigantic backpack um yeah sure I can show you guys the commuter bag if you really want we do have uh a commercial we just did and I believe oh no I think they just did the photography the product photography for the product page so I guess yeah it's probably not up there yet um oh seriously wow thanks so much wow there's so many people watching the stream today how you guys doing YouTube chat I never talked to you guys kosum says I play God of War Ragnarok using mouse and keyboard haah see this is why I don't talk to you guys because your psychos god of war with a keyboard and mouse I mean I've never played God of War so for all I know it's a perfectly valid option I'm just bugging you hm Connor suggests if you do a d Windows Windows you should do it in sections this is safe beginner friendly and then like increasing levels of kind of dangerous like before you get into kind of any sort of like regist reg editing yeah exactly I think removing the web search is registry registry is it registry yeah man but the thing is like if you I think there's scripts for it though yeah oh scripts are scarier I think running a script that edits your registry is way less safe than changing a couple of Val especially because the values often have names that somewhat seem kind of intuitive to what they do like if you're running a script that changes your registry I'd be pretty I'd be pretty skeed out by that you want to continue through the setup of uh God of War or the backpack you were on the backpack for the commuter I can get through the setup if you want right um yeah sure do you want to do you want to do the setup I I can kind of run you guys through it it's obviously not as big oh look Elijah's backpack is here that's convenient Elijah I'm going to borrow your backpack just for size reference I'm not going to dig through it yet okay so there's the size comparison but what's really cool about the commuter bag is that it's not as smaller or as it seems in terms of carrying capacity because the original bag has an internal water bottle holder and the commuter bag has an ex external water bottle holder so you do you do definitely have less carrying capacity and one of the biggest differences is here and the like device carrying oh okay well I can't open it but the point is that uh the original backpack has enough room to like stuff a steam deck at the bottom on top of your laptop and your tablet and then like another screen safe pocket there this is really designed for laptop tablet and that's about it if you want oh hey look Dan's got his there you go so there's the original which you could put like truly ridiculous class of Hardware in and still have room for like your your chargers and whatever else you need um and then yeah like I said it's got the two screen safe Pockets instead of just the one in the commuter and then this thick Boy Pocket that has screen safe material at the bottom for like an ally or steam deck or a claw or something like that so a little bit less device capacity but the pouch of holding does make a triumphant return so you can just like stash your Tech sack down in the bottom here you've got a bunch of organizing Pockets including some that are magnetic let's go or have zippers or like other means of kind of holding stuff in place um little kind of pocket down here our air tag pocket makes a return um it doesn't have the front organizing pouch either though which I really like for quick access but it's a smaller bag what do you want I think it's 25 rather than 35 lers or something like that does anyone know does anyone remember off the top of their head it'll be on the product page don't quote me on that um but all of that is while still being very Tech forward while still having extremely robust build quality so we've got our dual grommets on the carrying strap so that's not going to come off it's not going to wear out we've got um a reinforced Stitch as well as a grommet on the bottom here because I hate it when stuff like that wears out especially because it costs so little to reinforce it uh we've got the same style of straps that have been extremely popular on the original bag with sort of the the bridge here uh but we have the new contoured um shoulder straps that help make it a little bit more friendly to people with different widths of frames um that's a piece of feedback that we've gotten a lot on the original backpack is for more petite people uh it can be quite big and quite uh quite quite wide and it doesn't really doesn't really come in and like like sit properly on their body so these new contoured ones um seem to be very widely compatible with humans um I think that's about all I have to say about that since this game is apparently ready for us to play we are currently on 4K medium but you could adjust if you would like yeah I think we're not going to go 4K okay let's go let's go uh wait seriously is this not going to let me oh yeah sure sorry Andy watch your cable is it how do I uh seriously I don't want to good why why is modern gaming like this do I just have to set the render scale uh you might have to change the full screen so no it's that doesn't work oh I missed Okay so if I go window then I'm just stuck with window there's no full screen window let's see if chat has the solution here like is it just a is it just a scaling thing like render scale no this is just TAA Windows setting res yeah you might have to adjust it in Windows seriously it might be going based off your Windows settings for screen that is so stupid ridiculous people are like change desktop resolution that is that is ridiculous um okay well give me a minute there's a couple other things that I want to have a look at okay we're on xss TAA quality let's go uh let's go quality oh well that changes our resolution sure okay our render resolution is a little oh false our render resolution is a little above 1080P and then we're going to be using xcss to upscale it that's about what I had wanted to do anyway so there we go cool um okay anything with dead zones can I get rid of dead zones oh that wouldn't be in here anyway okay controller view controls can I no that's it maybe it's in gameplay I hate dead zones and I can't adjust them okay great oh fine whatever I'm over it oh my God we're compiling shaders uh what do you guys have running on here for FPS monitoring is that frame view or is that just the built-in steam one that's steam one did we did we not get frame view no cuz we had the built-in steam one oh okay uh the built-in steam one sucks we should use frew okay isn't dead zone the new like MOBA shooter uh no Deadlock but very close yeah Mr David can I help you are you I'm just hanging out I'm oh okay we're seven minutes over oh okay I'm not pressing you just hurry it up okay David's just standing here waiting hi lucky oh yeah Lucky's over there I actually curious how this dude this thing is killer to be well yeah but can it Whatever as well as yeah whatever got him okay there we go frame view INF guys I never used the steam one how do you turn it off because I don't care about it and I don't want it uh and uh Elijah enabled resizable bar okay good got it I found it okay okay all right now we have a proper FPS counter whoa that's new oh did it stop cool so our a FPS is sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of around 70 with our 1% lows hovering between High 40s and low 50s occasionally dipping way down to about 30 looks really good we're above 1080p right we're like I want to uh I want to skip this can I skip this no it's very short okay I love I love modern gaming in insert modern year uh Dan you have merch messages I've got one more all right hit me will it be better to wait for the 50 Series Nidia graphics cards or should I go for a 4080 super currently just curious given the Tariff situation that is a very good question and the answer is that I cannot answer that for you it seems like a lot of the Tariff conversations could be just saber rattling but you never know you never know what's going to happen when a new Administration takes over in the US and they are going to be dictating a lot of the terms for you know what the what the trading situation is going to look like into 2025 and Beyond so good luck everybody um we kind of laid out everything that we had to say about it and that should you buy a PC Now video that we did a little while ago so if you haven't watched that go ahead and watch it if you have watched it and you're looking for more information unfortunately I don't have any I don't have a functioning crystal ball sorry guys all right how we doing here it's almost over all right David assured me it's short so if it's not short then you know who to blame you blame David and if is short you know to blame thankfully he's not miked was a a short joke I am seeing a little bit of stutter here and there but I don't know how much of that is because we're compiling shaders in the background so unfortunately we're probably going to have to stall for time while this finishes compiling shaders and then we can get a fair impression of how the game is running so in the meantime uh Dan if you have any more merch messages coming in let me know otherwise hey maybe I'll do something really weird and I'll hang out with YouTube chat for a change scary I know right they are dude they are like unhinged every time I dive into YouTube chat I'm like why' I do this again what about twitch chat maybe they have something to say uh absolutely not no twitch chat's the worst what do you mean twitch chat's the worst they know they're the worst uh yeah Rob gar says Linus actually has no functioning balls I don't know that's functional like that's like that's a no no they don't function yeah I was going to say that's an accurate twitch comment no the uh no the balls function it's the it's the tube that connects them that doesn't function yeah so the yeah no if anything the balls function too good that's why I had to Nerf them that's a crazy statement otherwise I would get too many more kids so what did you call uh your wife on Ludwig's podcast I called her excellent breeding stock that's a to this day a crazy sentence what I mean it as a compliment it's a compliment it's a compliment look it was on a different it was on a different podcast okay it was on a different podcast where what happens at wo stays at w yeah that was W show that on the yard oh that's totally fine then that's a different y look she was there she I wouldn't say I wouldn't say anything about my wife that I wouldn't say in front of her I'm just I'm just saying that like for us to not have more kids steps needed to be taken we needed to take steps let's just go back to YouTube chat yeah let's go okay how's YouTube chat doing we've left uh we've left uh twitch chat now which is good a um extra cheese says Hey I just picked up a 7600 X 3D bundle at Microcenter for my first build What GPU should I grab I mean oh that's a tough one see like the best value gaming GPU on the market right now is the ARB 580 the one that we're featuring in our $500 build but you bought a 7600 X 3D you aren't building a $500 computer so I would say at the price that you're looking at I would probably start to look more into some of amd's more value options and I'm trying to remember uh what are the what are the currently available ones a I find amd's lineup to be really confusing like what they what they have available at any given time like something like 6700 class yeah looks like those are still those are still readily available it's like over $500 it's a good GPU though 12 gigs vram um I'd say that's probably a good place to start I see some people recommending 7900 gr but that's they got to you know it's balance right like they bought a 7600 x3d right they don't oh the GRE is whoa the GRE is cheaper than oh it's out of stock though yeah okay so if you could get one the GRE sure is a great deal but I don't see a single unit in stock does Micro Center have them man when did 70 when did 7900 GRE get so cheap poor Kratos sometimes AMD does this though where they like have a card or they have a variant of something that theoretically exists but in practice they just like bring it out they make a few of them kind of disrupt the market kind of like trash the value perception of the rest of their cards and then it functionally doesn't exist and you're just like okay um good job AMD because now no nobody knows what to recommend anybody um yeah on Micro Center there's one from XFX and it says X available in store only uh and is out of stock in literally every location and that's the only 7900 GRE they have so it's like yeah good recommendation but functionally doesn't exist so okay um like that's uh I remember having a conversation about this on wano a while back someone was like why do you never recommend AMD something was it like the Fury Fury cards or Vega or something and I was like because they're not real because AMD announced these cards made like 25 of them and then was like [Laughter] der and then they'll like do a price drop or whatever like promo them away and then effectively nobody's actually making anymore and I even I even brought it up on stre stream I was like here look here's all of the like this card available on new You' got like this one brand and you go to like add them to cart and if you add any more than two it's like no sorry you can't buy any more than that it's out of stock and it's like yeah this is not even a real product um so amd's GPU division has done that like a number of times over the last five six years where they have these products that nobody's actually building boards for AMD doesn't seem to be actually shipping any gpus they just exist as sort of like price disruptors for what amd's own lineup like I'm not saying price disruptors are bad they're good but they have to actually be available so that's one of the things that I've talked to Intel about with arcb 580 is like hey you need to talk to the partners you need to be like look guys okay $259.99 $269.99 for like you know if you've got a nice big cooler a really nice design or something like that okay but don't let this get out of control don't let them be like oh finally an opportunity to make money on Ark we let's make another 20 bucks a short-term thinking you got to buy some market share right now work with the partners make sure you guys are getting these cards in the hands of Gamers building up the brand building up the install base giving the driver team something to actually a reason to work on improving their driers so you have more than you know dozens of people out there enjoying art graphic like get the team motivated you guys all got to be pulling together there'll be time to make money make money later now is not the time um so I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping that that makes its way to the top that that makes its way to the add-in board Partners I can't guarantee it but I can hope shoot did I just do it again I don't know what it is but I'm going to put this on the other side cuz I'm no no no I'm just I'm going to put it on the other side so that I don't do that anymore okay there we go now I can now I can lean against my table I can get comfortable here all right shaders are almost compiled we're at 89% and this boy is still running pretty good definitely a little bit of pop in there definitely some dips and 1% lows definitely a wolf but at this it's a very demanding game though I was going to say at this price it's actually cheaper than like a PS5 and a PS5 Pro right so like no $500 well no sorry the the the disc list version I guess no the the the PS5 was on promo this Black Friday for like oh I missed that then oh that's my bad yeah I'm trying to think I think that was it that like 350 bucks or something like that there were some 380 okay PS5 Slims were going for as low as 380 for Black Friday so a PlayStation is still an outstanding value from a hardware standpoint but the difference is that you're locked into their game store so you're not going to be able to use our sponsor Green Man Gaming to get tons of great deals on games um you're going to be stuck paying with with a console you're going to be stuck paying subscription fees potentially you're going to be stuck with um a higher potential cost to repair it if anything happens down the line whereas with a PC that's modular like this something goes wrong you just fart a new one into it and you're good to go so there are like anything there are pros and cons both ways people who game on PlayStation are not idiots they just take that set of tradeoffs that they prefer and people who game on PC are not big dumb idiots they're just people who prefer that set of tradeoffs um so no a PlayStation 5 is absolutely still a very compelling value from a hardware standpoint it's just that what we are now is very comfortably within the price bracket we're we're within the price range instead of having awkward conversations that go hey lonus I bought a 7600 x3d at Micro Center What GPU would you recommend and literally the only like stepup class of GPU that I can find is going to cost you $600 freaking dollars just for the GPU before you've even got a case CPU Ram power supply cooler anything else right and that's what I am super excited about that's why we did the stream we only planned this stream when I sat down and did script review um no I think it was even after script review I think it was when we uploaded the video I watched it back I started reading some of the comments from people and I was like holy crap we can we can oh no must have been script review because it was in script review that I was like hey we should talk about how you can kind of build a $500 gaming PC again okay it must have been then but we only planned this like last minute to do a stream building a $500 gaming PC because I was like oh my goodness this is it this is the key this is what unlocks it um so this was just cuz I was excited to finally be able to show you guys with a straight face a great value gaming machine with all new parts for around 500 bucks it's 540 for those of you tuning in now $540 we did cheat a little bit but there are areas where you could save yourself 40 bucks instead of buying a brand new case you could just go find one uh at a local recycler ATX standard hasn't changed in years decades actually literally decades so you could throw this Hardware in some random case pull the side panel off you know get out to PA pliers just bend things out of the way if you got to stick your GPU in there you could save some money there you could probably save some money on the motherboard if you're willing to go for like a weird like you know TOA um to Bow brand or something like that uh I think you could probably Save A Buck on the power supply if you're willing to go with like a thermal T smart you could even get this under 500 bucks but 540 was what we were comfortable with with all brand new parts from brands that we know are going to actually back you up in the event of a warranty claim or something like that freaking incredible our shaders are 99% compiled and let's have a look at God of War Ragnarok on a $500 gaming PC we're running at 4K but not native we're using xcss upscaling and so the native rendering is at about 1080p so this is about what you'd get at 1080p in terms of frame rates about it's actually a little higher all right come on shaders man don't you love that don't you love that computer developers they they have the world's most warped definition of the last 1% of things that I think is possible I and I understand it's not entirely it's not the developer's fault there can be unexpected challenges and I get it I get it I get it I get it I'm not ragging on you you do great work thank you uh but ah there we go we are finally done compiling shaders all right am I allowed to skip this no it's a cinematic experience L all right it's a cinematic experience well what we can do is we can nope because there's depth the field so we can't even evaluate how sharp it looks now we can actually not bad there's some messiness in the beard uh when it's moving so you're you're definitely yeah as his as his face swings back and forth if you know what you're looking for you're going to see a little bit of upscaling artifacting I'm also seeing the odd dropped frame but we've also talked a fair bit about how this is not a 4K card this is it well outside of its comfort zone uh turkey submarine says I wish I knew the specs of the PC yeah we can run through that so we've got a uh ryzen 5 5600 right uh or was 5500 sorry it was a 5500 5500 ryzen 5 5500 six core processor 16 gigs of ddr4 3200 megat transfer per second memory we went with an ASRock microatx motherboard the just the cheapest we could find from a trusted brand uh we've got a Corsair cx550 550 wat power supply that was the minimum that Lucas from the lab would allow us to use even though we could probably save some money with oh it's not there anymore but whatever with with a cheaper power supply uh this a DIY PC some cheap case just the cheapest thing we could find and then an Intel Arc b580 a patriot p300 SSD oh yeah that's right Patriot p300 SSD as well we went with a 512 gig because that's what fit in our budget if we wanted more storage then we've got four SATA ports and I did confirm there is in fact a hard drive mounting point in the bottom of the case so we could add something there and am I ever going to get to actually play the game remember when David said that this opening cinematic thing was short yeah I I remember remember when chat picked this game let's blame chat yeah way to go way to go float plane chat 175 gigs of just movies that's crazy all right let's go come on yes yes yes you need to sleep I know it's tiring being the God of War whoever said they wanted Firefox as the game that's not an option you can't can't have that look I know you all play Firefox we just wanted you here longer yeah I mean mission accomplished then I suppose all right I'm going back to I'm going back to YouTube chat they seem more trustworthy YouTube chat Redemption Arc wow um maybe they just go really weird on Friday nights we're not at 2500p upscale to 4K Toby we're at more like 2200 which is a lot lesser than it sounds like as resolution scales um the amount that you're adding is so much more or as you go bigger or oh whoa look at that we're in game hey we're in game what up yo all right we're going this way can I run oh okay dude not bad not bad you're playing like modern AAA games like for real on this machine our previous attempts at like budget gaming PCs for the last like five years have been so frustrating because either we had to go secondhand which I know there's a there's a cohort of people out there that are just not going to consider it right so we either had to go second hand which upsets those people or we had to seriously seriously compromise on performance like when we did our holiday buyers guide Arc battle mage wasn't out yet our recommended PC had an APU because we were like well realistically at this price you can't afford a GPU anyway so you might as well get an APU which will game at like 108p low in AAA games or might even be forced to go down to 720p and then you can save up for a GPU it was like the merry Christmas wait for your birthday PC I think was what we called it this is the merry Christmas right now today PC as long as you can get your hands on an arcb 580 super exciting and I think that pretty much wraps US unless Dan you have another merch message or two I have one final merch message for today all right hit me from Anonymous they bought a Precision multi pit and a Precision buil set your laptop skin looks absurd you weren't supposed to use it beyond the Qualcomm daily driver challenge signed a robot uh oh no way no way I could actually be debrand I mean no one else would have any way of knowing that I wasn't supposed to continue to using it it's not even for my laptop like honestly I keep using it as much to upset them as anything else so they're they're on to me like look at this it has a cutout for a Microsoft Surface this isn't a surface you know how they're all about Precision Fit and everything this doesn't fit at all this is just complete complete nonsense and I've added more stickers to it now yeah I know it really does look awful if you don't like it dbrand maybe you should make better skins oo like the glow circuit and you could check out our uh you could check out our sponsor Green Man Gaming uh they've got a great sale running right now we picked up did I just break something cool did that game close when I dropped my computer next to the PC that was weird did I did I click something I I was not paying enough attention all right neat anyway uh the point is uh Green Man Gaming check them out we picked up some actually pretty great deals on games including you suck at parking um we're going to have them Linked In the video description thank you guys very much for tuning into the stream big thanks to Dan and Elijah pathetic um all right play me out Dan for next copyrighted no no no don't sing don't sing don't sing real songs you can cut it though"

This review looks at the Starforge ""Lowkey,"" a limited edition mini-ITX pre-built PC assembled and designed by Starforge Systems, a Texas-based system integrator (SI) that builds gaming PCs. This is part of our prebuilt gaming PC reviews series and gives us a more positive product to look at, following a series of less well-designed products in review recently. We previously reviewed Starforge's Horizon II Ultra gaming PC and found it to be overall good quality, with a few issues on screw torque and attention to detail items. Starforge is owned by streamers who are part of OTK, such as Asmongold, Tips, and others, and started after the collapse of Artesian Builds. You can learn about that story below.

Correction: The chart software truncated the X-axis label for the frequency spectrum plot. The last two frequencies in the range are 10,000 Hz and 20,000 Hz. This has been resolved going forward by expanding the 'buffer' space between the axis label and the axis line itself.

Gamers nexus.net after almost 2 years of requests we're finally bringing back a restock of our original drink coaster pack featuring a carefully leveled and designed fan blade that supports drink wear with stability while representing a PC case fan in 3D with the soft rubberized material it also has a motherboard coaster design with inductors capacitors and even CPU pins in a socket we custom designed all of this in 3D software just like we did for the animation in this review the third of four coasters has a densely packed GN logo the fourth has a GPU on substrate packaging surrounded by vram these coasters are great for catching condensation are extremely easy to clean with just light rinsing out of sink and are a highquality flexible material and they're finally back to support our ability to buy pre-build for independent unbiased reviews we also just restocked our brand new copper plated stainless steel Mule mugs with a thermal conductivity formula for copper on them these make an excellent period with The Coasters support our educational animations deep Dives and custom testing and get great drink wear and 3D PC themed coasters in return at store. Gamers access.net we're going to get straight into the review today cuz we have a ton of benchmarks to get through the very brief backstory is that star Forge is a relatively new system integrator or Si they are based near Austin Texas that's where the assembly for the PCS happens and uh star Forge functions as a system integrator relatively independently as we understand it however it is owned by otk or at least the members of it which is a streamer organization uh the company carries on a trend of streaming a lot of its PC builds to Twitch and uh I think elsewhere but the streamers aren't the builders normally are you kidding me yeah I feel like a caveman so where the does this thing go although if that were the build that we were reviewing today it probably make the tear down a lot more interesting speaking of tear Downs though all right we're going to start with a tear down so the number one thing this needs to do do is not have loose screws I think we found like six last time really got to figure out this screw situation man which by the way I don't think I've ever seen so many salute emojis for screw guy before hopefully hopefully he's okay uh so this is the fractal tarot we've reviewed this case you can check the channel for the full review has some pretty cool mechanical features like the doors that swing up and attach like this with this like lever action in here and then disassembles entirely very quickly internally the first thing I noticed when we pulled that top off was actually this spine is very slightly bowed it's curved and the reason this is is because this particular case will allow you to shift the spine into these numbered positions which these don't lock into place you manually have to position it and it does that so that the Builder can bias the spine to allow more room for either the cooler or for the the GPU so they had to move it a little bit towards me to fit that CPU Cooler and what they did is they got this screw holding the spine in place exactly on the three on the line this one's just a little bit off and the end result is that there's a tiny curvature here so what I'm curious about is if we loosen it if it's just going to kind of like pop back into place this is the moment this is the first screw is it going to be a a loose one no if asmin reacts to this right now he's going like oh my God bro the spine here in the center it did straighten just a little bit but it's also been kind of bent into place now so anyway that's something we'd like to see done they didn't do any catastrophic damage all right so first thing I noticed here cable management is once again Immaculate which is exactly what I said about the last one we looked at from Star Forge you see the attention to detail down here so these front panel connectors uh one of these is either SATA or usb3 I can't see from here but it's routed around that fan so squarely and cleanly right into the only Channel where they have space it's excellent it makes sure that it's not ever going to end up in the fan even in shipping so that's well done they've also routed these uh well and hidden them underneath the CPU Cooler so that's good to see this one is tied in place tidily with the power supply sort of Mount here on the GPU side they've also done well with kale management to get this nice Bend in it uh and tidy everything up over here with some other cables shoved in the bottom in a way that's pretty clean overall so happy to see that now we need to get to what apparently was the most difficult part last time this part let's see how they do let's start with the GPU that was actually in there two for two we good there okay GPU comes free I'm going to disconnect this cable which is fully seated no current complaints all right this part's going to suck cuz I'm going to have to undo all of their great Cable Management to get further into the system but we'll do that now uhoh no false alarm just looking for like strip damage I don't see any so that's good piling all the screws up on our soldering mat on the store now the pan in the as starts that's good that's good I hope they gave screw guy another chance all right Cooler's going to come off this will let us inspect the thermal paste there you go okay I that's good they uh they used more than necessary which is what I like to see uh it's not going to hurt it's it's only a good thing I probably can forensically identify whoever installed it so keep that in case that's useful but the the thermal paste application's good spread evenly uh pressure distribution is as you would expect for an Intel CPU or you've got that curvature reflected in there then on the CPU itself you can see we have full coverage the whole IHS and a little bit of spill over even so that looks pretty good okay what a hell of a Bend ouch it's not going to hurt anything all the cables were seated fully so that's good we don't always see that in pre-builts small interesting point the ram is exactly what they specify on the website a lot of uh SI will just ship you ram of roughly the same spec but no specific uh brand so that's that's cool as well now in Star forge's favor here there are a lot fewer screws and an IX PC build so the grading criteria here is going to be a much harder scale I will slide the scale to make it more difficult to pass so far all four of the motherboard screws are good I hope so cuz I'm not sure if screw guy will get a second chance here but we can only hope that third chance third chance we can only hope that they're so benevolent there's another thing that they failed on last time so star Forge overall last time was excellent assembly uh with the the issue being again screw torque and also the m.2 peel these are all fully seated uhoh what's going to be it's okay they got the peel so that's that's both primary critiques past this time is attached to the SSD right there oh that was in there all right looks good just put as much suspense in there as possible all right bro cuz for a second I was stressed fun fact this cooler manufacturer deep cool has now been banned by the US government to be fair star Forge uh had these in its possession for many months before that ban went out and this was sold and shipped to us before that ban went out but that makes it extra rare and if you want to learn more about why they were banned you can watch our Hardware news episode I'll link it below we're going to take the power supply out just to check the last few screws okay so screw inspection pass 100% zero screws were too loose so good job no issues really to speak of so the assembly here is excellent quality let's go to the next section let's start with bios star Forge emailed our undercover customer account August 16th advising us to update BIOS and run the most recent micro code revision the email linked instructions recommended occt stability testing and extended our motherboard CPU and RAM warranties for four additional years beyond the purchase stage for six total the instructions are clear easy to understand and most importantly proactive this is excellent handling of a problem that star Forge ultimately didn't cause and appropriately it's one that we think asmin gold one of the owners of star Forge is now experiencing with his own system on stream I knew it was going to work see the thing is that there if there's one thing that I've learned in my life is that if you beat your head against the wall long enough if eventually you will break through that wall you just have to do it for longer than anybody else and once degradation starts Intel itself has said that new micro code won't fix it and that an RMA is the only solution so star Forge getting this message out to customers soon is important and they're doing more for people than Intel we think on the other hand if asmin gold ends up not needing his CPU anymore we'd like to bore a hole through asmin gold CPU and use a focused ion beam and transmission electron microscope to do failure analysis with a lab contact but that might be another story back to the lowkey our testing was performed with outof thebox settings CPU LLC and bios was manually set to level two which is abnormal but not a problem this could be done to minimize voltage spikes if star Forge was aware of Intel's impending implosion and maybe they were pl2 was left at 181 Watts but pl1 was lowered to 125 watts which is arguably the normal setting depending on how you interpret Intel's biz team guidelines or maybe it's not normal and Intel actually wants you to use the performance profile except if it's not supported by the vrm except don't use Baseline for 13th or 14th gen casq CPUs unless the vrm doesn't support performance and remember that Baseline isn't default because default is all the settings including Baseline performance and extreme and Intel strongly recommends applying these settings except some Prevail over others so it is actually impossible to apply all of them Intel's guidelines have created an actual infinite Loop in some situations but that Loop could be broken if you have 1400k and a 1300k in which case they recommend the extreme profile unless the motherboard doesn't support it in which case they don't say what you should use instead but they do say that you shouldn't use Baseline so probably through process of elimination that means performance but let's be clear Intel's recommended default settings aren't actual enforced guidelines because then they can shk responsibility and pull motherboard manufacturers out of their hat of blame for going on a decade now the good news is that star fors chose settings that make sense for this build as we received it bio settings were customized more than usual for a pre-built PC which is pretty cool XMP was enabled which is the first hurdle that most pre-builts fail to clear specifically xmp1 was enabled which in Asus terminology doesn't actually mean xmp1 because that would be obvious it instead means some of the primary XMP settings with other timings optimized by Asus but this is a prebuilt not a test bench so that's fine the other changes include these Asus performance enhancement 3.0 is disabled this is the correct thing to do Intel adaptive boost technology was disabled this is more of an unusual choice and it Nerfs all core performance but it proved necessary given the small downdraft cooler and cooling limitations most interestingly star Forge manually switched micro code version to 0104 instead of 0123 which is available on the BIOS that they shipped with with this there's a global negative offset of 0.1 volts on core and cash sbid resulting from the micro code switch As for why they might have done this back in February or March star Forge probably saw speculation that micro code versions 0104 and 0105 keep CP temperatures lower and maybe they decided that it made sense to use that micro code our own testing has actually shown that temperatures are in fact incorrectly reported on at least MSI and Asus motherboards with that micro code version to prove this we brought a 13900 K CPU to a local machine shop and asked them to CNC mill a channel into the heat spreader this allowed us to embed our calibrated kype thermocouple into the IHS and remain flush with the cooler that'll give us an absolute ground truth temperature for something we can measure rather than relying on internal temperature sensors from Intel which can be manipulated now it's going to be a little distant from the Silicon itself so it will be a different measurement and that's fine what we care about here is the Delta against ambient we also shoved the thermal couple through a hole in a motherboard socket on our separate MSI test platform giving us Underside readings with a CPU that did not have the mil channel so we had one unmodified test with a normal IHS and one with a customized IHS we're going to keep this simple because we'll explain it in a future piece but this chart shows two things the pord delta T over ambient and the heat spreader thermocouple temperature delta T over ambient the left to access shows the micro code version and BIOS version if at any point the pord temperature increases but the IHS temperature does not that indicates a change to the sensor Behavior because the PE sensor is something that is controlled in part by micro code rather than an actual change to the real temperature we know this because we also logged power at the EPS 12 volt C cables and in Hardware info throughout the testing and all of these are at exactly 284 Watts plus or minus one watt of variance in CPU package power the deviation between CV package power and our external power measurement was also constant suffice to say the numbers are correct we checked them with other methods as well that don't belong in this video they'll go out soon though we found that micro code versions 0125 and 010e plotted about 6° celsi higher P core despite the IHS temperature being within variant which means that this is not an actual change in the real temperature it's a change in the sensor just to prove our work here's a chart of the idle temperatures over ambient it is physically impossible to run below ambient with the setup physics won't allow it you need something like liquid nitrogen for that bios revisions 0104 and 0105 both measured below ambient on the P core but above it on the IHS you can see the IHS was relatively consistent in all these tests here's the chart for the CPU only test meaning no GPU load yet the max core temperature spiked to 955 to 96° C during the initial pl2 boost period with the room temperature at about 21 to 22 C you can see a sharp curve indicating that the CPU was seconds away from thermal throttling putting thermal velocity boost aside which has a dumb threshold of 70° C but only applies to higher-end CPUs the hard TJ Maxx of this CPU the 13600 KF is 100° C the Boost period expired just in time to avoid that 100 C limit in each test pass with the maximum core temperature then leveling out at around 80c after it hit hits the limit 80° C isn't bad but forcibly limiting frequency is an unfortunate downside of ITX and small coolers but it's better doing it this way than just running it unrestrained entirely here's a look at the fan response plotted on the right Axis for the same charge you can see a heavy ramp initially blasting up to 1880 RPM during the heaviest load period and being unable to keep up with the heat it's expected again that a small downdraft cooler won't keep up and part of the power limiting is not only for thermal but also for noise the fan drops and Rises a few times mostly steadying around 1,600 to 1700 RPM the initial load period prior to the pl drop already showed frequency throttling with boosting to 5100 MHz for average PE core and rapidly falling you can see the red Spike representing maximum single core temperature corresponding with the frequency Decay to 48 70 MHz at steady state after the pl barrier expiry at 250 seconds which would be about 60 seconds after load start clocks dropped to a fairly steady 3300 to 3400 MHz range on the ecor is not plotted here and 4,400 to 4500 MHz on the PES with the all core average at 3860 MHz this chart shows the frequency of star forges configuration versus the original 13600 K from our review with the original Intel guidelines offered by Intel during the review cycle for the 13600 K so that would be for a CPU running at a higher power budget about 2 years before Intel's concerns became public star forge's configuration is down by 500 to 600 MHz from the completely flat 3900 MHz ecor uh not shown here here and 600 MHz down from the 5100 MHz pee clocks that we saw in our original review sample 13600 K this is not sample variant this isn't a change it's just differences in how they're configured in BIOS as a result of star Forge being both aware of the newer problems that Intel has and also being in a small box now our original review sample numbers match the 20 13600 kfs that we tested for our not enough samples video if you want to learn about sample size and the reason for these results is again because of BIOS it's not inherently a bad thing to limit the frequency boosting if it's to try and keep it within the thermal limitations of the case it's just the nature of ITX but we do have some more thoughts on that that we'll revisit in the conclusion the full torture workload is next starting with GPU thermals the 4070 super leveled off around 67° C with Hots spot memory temperatures around 79 and 73° respectively GPU temperature peaked at 73 before the GPU fans ramped resulting in a peak GPU fan speed of 2400 RPM but as the system reached steady state the speed dropped to around 2100 these temperatures are completely acceptable there was nothing abnormal and there was no non- boost throttling and the GPU remained strictly power constrained at its stock 220 wat limit which is good a star Forge swapped out the stock deep cool fan for an Arctic p12 slim pwm PST with an identical fan added to the bottom of the case as exhaust both of these fans use asus's default curve which maxes out at a reported CPU temperature of 70° C the placement of the bottom exhaust fan isn't ideal but that's due to the case Design Star forge's setup aligns with the recommendations we made in our Tera review we also did an AB test with the bottom exhaust fan flipped to intake the chart shows that star forge's chosen configuration of bottom exhaust performs 3 degrees better for CPU thermals than bottom intake when looking at Delta over ambient results that's a big difference and it shows someone at Star Forge chose the ideal setup and the one which is maybe less obvious that's great here's something cool though this is an educational 3D animation that we made for the review to help explain why this Behavior happens since bottom intake would be the natural inclination for many but as worse we thought it' help after all cooler air is closer to the ground if the bottom fan were flipped to intake the entire system would be heavily biased towards a positive pressure configuration as opposed to negative pressure a positive pressure configuration for a computer means that more air is forced in than is forced out by fans and so to achieve some level of equilibrium the pressure system will naturally dictate that outflow will occur at every single hole in the case that doesn't have active intake this can cause some recirculation of warmed air and means that you'd lose control over where precisely the exhaust is in this situation the CPU tower cooler have vertically oriented aluminum fins for their heat sinks this means that the fin stack is pushing some of the exhaust out the bottom of the case with a bottom intake fan this air would be immediately pulled back in and recirculated raising the internal ambient temperature that's why it performs worse it would also get pulled in through the side panels as it exits the bottom so there's more recirculation with bottom exhaust that warmed air is jettisoned from the bottom of the case and it would get pushed away from the system by that extra bottom exhaust fan so it not only prevents recirculation at the bottom but it will also limit the recirculation at the sides that's why this unconventional setup is so successful for Star forge's build and if you find these animations helpful to understanding the science behind the performance and please support the extra work we do for these on the GN store at store. Gamers access.net now we'll get into noise testing in this chamber here's the DBA over time chart the lowkey was extremely quiet when idle especially for an air cooled system in a case that had acoustic issues in our original review measured at 1 meter and in a noise floor of about 14 DBA the noise level at idle was indistinguishable from the noise floor which is awesome in the first 170 seconds of this test it's effectively totally silent when idle when the torture load started the fan ramped immediately to a peak of about 29 DBA SPL at 1 M synchronized perfectly with the CPU and the case fan speeds as the cpu's initial boost expired and its temperature dropped the noise level dropped back down to 26 DBA and then gradually Rose back to 29 DBA over the next 5 minutes here's the frequency spectrum plot during the steady state portion of the noise test the major peaks in the audible range were around 370 HZ and 633 HZ smaller Peaks appeared around 223 and8 144 Herz the Tera is prone to producing an annoying hum but since the case doesn't come with any stock fans the noise is actually produced completely dependent on what the hardware is and where it's installed so while the Tera influences this the fans can change it star Forge used the same deep cool an600 tower that we did in our Tera review last year and we heard again the usual hum resulting from the CPU Cooler pulling air through the teras side panel however star Forge successfully dropped to noise levels by replacing the Cooler's fan as shown on the frequency plot this completely altered the character of the noise we're not sure if they saw our findings or if they did this testing but either way this is absolutely what we would have recommended and star Forge did well to work this out the reason you'll get that weird or annoying oscillating noise sometimes is when you have slats for cooling like the Tera does where it has these vertical up and down slots there's a blade passing frequency and depending on the shape of the blade you can get this resistive back pressure almost that causes that noise as it hits the metal part of the slat and applies back pressure to the fan blade itself power testing is our last Benchmark for this test we used a login wall meter during thermal testing which resulted in a very clean graph of three full system torture passes followed by two CPU only blender passes during full system torture passes Peak power draw for the whole system was approximately 490 watt this dropped to 415 as soon as pl2 expired with load on the CPU alone shown in the last two passes here full system power draw peaked around 286 watts and then held steady at 264 Watts until pl2 expired after that it remained at 194 Watts for the duration of the test all of these numbers are well within the limits of the Corsair sf750 power supply that star for decided on for this build they've left an appropriate amount of Headroom without going completely overboard on the power capacity so that's good now we're on to software setup the system is free of any third party software fortunately bios and drivers were up to date as of March 28th which is when the system was set up for a shipping date of April 1st which means they don't let the images sit for too long it's awesome we like that the Windows key is stored in a text file on the C drive which is hugely appreciated because certain bios or micro code changes can sometimes trigger deactivation some scraps of star forge's automated setup process were left behind but nothing big other than some unused desktop backgrounds the only problem we noticed was that a real Tech audio device showed as missing in the Windows device manager before connecting to the internet star for should be ensuring that all drivers are installed and working without needing to First connect to the network this should have been caught in a final check it's something you can do with the system offline the onboard and front panel audio jacks still worked fine but it's just good system hygiene to make sure devmgmt.msc shows everything as installed now for packaging and accessories there's some hits and some misses in this section star Forge reused the terra's original packaging for the lowkey except nested it inside of a larger box with a layer of bubble wrap in between as delivered the only external damage on the lowkey was a small area of missing paint on the front panel it's about a 7 mm long strip that just fell off at some point it's definitely visible and it's definitely noticeable we couldn't find any paint residue anywhere in the packing material or otherwise that would imply it was shipping damage it doesn't appear to have come off on one of the surfaces it was against so it may have just been damaged at the warehouse or improperly painted some downsides the there was no documentation whatsoever included in the system we found this to be a positive in our original Star Forge review that it included documentation so we were disappointed to see it gone there was no quick guide there's no QR code for an online guide there's no sticker over the motherboard's video ports or manuals for any of the components or warranty paperwork for any of the components the only thing left was a piece of cardboard with some Tera concept art which is included with the Tera weirdly so are other things that didn't make it into this box for example fractal includes 10 mm power supply standoffs with Tera that can in some situations drastically impact their whole performance we saw this in some parts of our testing and our review but these weren't included in the packaging our last system at least came with an instruction card so we assume it was left out of this one by mistake and unfortunately that is a mistake that will create one of the few marks against the system in this review as a positive accessories like all of the unused power sply cables the GPU 12volt 2x6 adapter dongle and the wireless antenna were kept packed and tidy all right the positives and negatives are pretty clear with this one so we'll go through it line by line star Forge exceeded our expectations for the BIOS configuration they made some manual and intentional changes to bios that were good for example the BIOS configuration that star Forge loaded had a negative 0.1 volt offset so they technically undervolted it by a little bit and that is something that uh especially now we know is a good move back then I don't know how much information they had but it still would have helped thermally but there was one part of BIOS that we would not advis which is the choice to go with the micro code version that they did so they're manually loading an older micro code than the BIOS natively supports in the Bios the reason we think they might have done this is because technically if you use that bios it looks like the temperature is lower but the reality is the temperature sensing is broken so the actual reason it's lower it's not actually lower like the reality of it when you look at the Deltas the real temperature is the same it's just the sensing and the presentation of it is either intense Ally manipulated by Intel or is broken by Intel both of those are Intel things now for the information star Forge would have had at the time and made that choice we think its Choice makes sense in the context of the time the computer was built it's just that today we have enough information to know we wouldn't do that uh but we're not going to fault them for something that didn't really come to light until later star Forge also exceeded expectations by extending its warranty on top of Intel screw up this is exactly what SI need to do to compete with each other so that's good the build itself shows a sort of General physical skill as you walk through the whole thing where first of all the kale management once again is excellent they've done very well with the small amount of space they have uh additionally there were some specific choices that star forges team made such as the fan configuration installing the bottom fan as exhaust might seem counterintuitive but it's actually the correct way to do it for this build so that's good attention to detail the cables also did not droop into that fan even in shipping so that took some care to manage them all and uh tie them down so they wouldn't droop we saw similar good attention to detail with the choice to swap the fan on the CPU Cooler which reduced some of the humming that you would hear with the stock fan in this specific case all of these but especially the choices around the fans illustrate to us that whoever designed this configuration is clearly plugged into the Enthusiast Community this comes across as a company actually researching and trying to do well with its builds or at least someone there is rather than any number of Si that sometimes seem to just juice Parts almost at random and that's refreshing to see now for the criticisms and the feedback on this one the damage paint was the first thing that greeted us out of the box given the limited nature of this specific build it was a huge let down star Forge needs to take extra QC measures to make sure limited builds leave the warehouse Prine I mean they should do that for most builds but especially limited ones where it's not as easy to just swap them we couldn't find evidence of the paint damage happening during shipping or in contact with packing materials although it is possible if that were the case if we're being charitable about it we still think starford should consider a protective strip of something in front of the custom vinyl sticker or paint jobs that they do and we also would like to see the instructions and the manuals included again our last star Forge pre-built had an included card with setup instructions that was missing here likewise although star Forge included the extra power supply cables which is great we did not see the extra four power supply standoffs normally included with the Terra finally the thermal Situation's just brutal with this case there's not a ton that can be done about that star Forge also configured the fans custom to help with this and the reality is that there are just physical limitations to Cooling in this case for a build with these components we think star forge's overall balance is good but that they should have customized the fan curve this is something we actually scrutinized last time as well there's room in the fan curve to improve this Balancing Act further looking at prices so the price of a like for- likee build without a custom case would be around $17 $50 adding the cost of Windows licensing and let's just say miscellaneous accessories call it maybe $1850 at this pricing extra cost Beyond DIY was about $550 to maybe $600 and all these are based on prices of the time we bought it not today because that wouldn't be fair so $550 to $600 markup even today it's pretty similar to that the star Forge Horizon 2 ultra we reviewed last year had a pre-built overhead of $450 so it looks like star for for's two customer price difference is about the same except with maybe $100 to $150 added for the color customization on this one so they still put star Forge in the middle of the pack just like last time with a little extra for the custom colors now for comparison iy power and cyber power sometimes they have this remarkable race to the bottom where some of their builds are only $100 build fee effectively which is absolutely insane uh there's some sort of boring business reasons for that that we won't get into mostly has to do with volume pricing and with not specifying the exct components but giving kind of a broad scope of them and choosing whatever's available and cheap at the time uh this one is it's more expensive than them it's cheaper than companies like Corsair where Corsair on the other hand will charge you five grand for a computer that is overheating to the point it throttles but also is misconfigured in BIOS for the power levels for the CPU to begin with so it doesn't even boost properly or sells you a $6,000 computer with water cooling for a CPU which is 1 GHz below the advertised speed that was a fun review uh so that's cors here at the other end that's the that shows you that more money doesn't necessarily get more quality but that's cors here they're busy right now anyway they're talking about how uh GTA 6's delay caused them to miss their quarterly estimates for earnings per share by 250% so we'll leave that for another time ultimately with the pre-built you're paying for the SI the system integrator to put thought into the configuration to build it competently so that you don't have to and so you don't have to fix things they did uh and to deal with things like support issues in the future so we think overall star Forge has nailed it with a number of these things for support they've extended warranty uh not just the component that uh Intel provides and might have problems but also the components effectively attached to it which is great that's a step beyond what was necessary love to see it this exactly what SI need to do to set themselves apart last time with the uh Horizon I said I would give it away to someone I know personally because I didn't think it would come back to me and cause support issues for me which is the only criteria I have when giving something from the office away after we've bought it and we've reviewed it uh like a preil and that computer has not come back to me in fact I have not heard a word about it since I gave it to the person I know so other than that it works great so that was good to hear uh this one I'm probably going to do the same with I know someone who could use this system and uh after we bought it and reviewed it I it's going to sit on a shelf so I'm going to give this one away too and maybe that'll be our secondary test a couple years I can let you all know if any of them come back to me uh we've done this with a few prebuilds the only ones we haven't given away are the ones that truly suck in which case I P out the components and then we figure out what to do with them from there so anyway that's it for this one thanks for watching subscribe for more go to store. gamas access.net to help us out directly with our purchasing of things like these pre-builts that are sometimes pretty expensive like one of the $5,000 ones we have coming up from a different company that's it thanks for watching we'll see you all next time"

phone that has a built-in cooling fan okay so over here is the gaming phone it's from a company called red magic and I actually checked out their website as well and they also sell like gaming tablets which definitely would be a lot easier to play on compared to an actual like phone cuz this thing is just really really small compared to a tablet but either way this thing would be really portable for gaming now this thing actually costs around like $800 which is actually very expensive literally for a phone I don't even think like the iPhone 16 cost $800 but I mean this thing is designed to play like AAA title games so I'm definitely going to test out fortnite war zone mobile and I'm not sure valerant mobile came out but if it did we're going to test that out as well Inside the Box we obviously have the phone which is honestly really really Slim it kind of just looks like every other Android phone but yeah really Slim and also really light we also have like this cardboard thing with the red magic logo we have this braided USBC cable which we're going to use to charge the phone and we also have the phone's power brick and that should be it for everything inside the box now just keep in mind this thing cost $800 so it actually costs more than some like gaming laptops maybe even some gaming PCs but definitely for a phone this thing is one of the fastest gaming phones on the market it has the latest Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and inside this phone actually has 16 GB of the fastest ddr5 Ram as well now not too sure how that all performs in inside a phone but literally with this super slim design it's probably just super compact inside now literally just take a look at this phone this thing is really really reflective it honestly just gives such a like a gaming phone Vibe take a look at the back this thing has like some carbon fiber looking design with the red magic logo on the back as well and there's actually like a little sticker right here that says 5G mobile phone with like all the manufacturers and stuff in the back as well now this phone definitely should be really really powerful for gaming but I'm not too sure how good anything else is like the camera quality it does have two cameras so it shouldn't be too bad also just take a look at this charging brick I don't know why the design of this thing also looks super super nice now $800 is definitely crazy price point just for a phone but since this thing is probably like one of the fastest phones on like the gaming phone market the company implemented the red Core 2 Pro gaming chip onto this phone so for games like fortnite it's definitely going to have a really really nice playing experience now I'm pretty sure this phone also has RGB I just don't know where the power button is you guys can see there's just like a bunch of buttons on this phone I'm going assume this thing right here is the power button so let's press on that okay honestly has a really nice little icon for charging but how do I turn this thing on I'm actually so confused is it this red button right here can't even press on this thing you could flick like a switch does that thing turn it on I'm so confused okay I'm hold on to this thing maybe it turns on okay there we go I got this thing to turn on but yeah this thing does have like the fastest gaming chip for a phone so we're going to test this out for gaming obviously a lot of you guys aren't going to drop $800 just for gaming on a phone but I'm going to test out the game but I'm going to test out the gaming experience if you guys do decide to drop $800 on a phone which once again is just absurd but yeah as you guys can see this thing is running on Android so since it is Android we can just download fortnite directly from the Google Play Store now one more thing about this phone is that over here I believe is is like the cooling system for the phone so it is kind of like a PC does have like its own cooling system obviously phones do overheat a lot whenever you're gaming I'm pretty sure the fan is this part over here on the phone I can already hear this thing kind of like starting up with like the fans and stuff but I'm pretty sure there is a cooling fan literally inside the phone which is honestly really cool it's actually telling me if I want to turn on the fan or not let's actually confirm all right let's go ahead and download all the games we're going to test out on this phone okay so I finished setting up the phone and it actually just loaded up some red magic application thing okay so I actually figured out what this thing is and over here on the side the red button I flicked earlier if you turn it off this thing just disappears yeah it just disappears just like that that's honestly really cool because you can adjust like the fans and stuff just from this one button over here you can also adjust the fans as you guys can see when I press it kind of just controls how fast the fans run on the back okay so I went ahead and downloaded fortnite in war zone these are the two games I'm going to test out with this phone now something else from this phone that I found really cool is that in the setting there's actually a cooling fan option basically allowing you to customize the fan I'm not sure if you guys can see it but there's literally a fan inside of this phone so in like the cooling fan mode we can switch it over to fast cooling then if we turn this red switch up as you guys can see we enter into like a gaming mode this is just absolutely insane this phone is literally made just for gaming and then in this software right here we can just change a bunch of stuff I'm not too sure what's going on but this thing is literally like just a software for the phone to exit out you can just go ahead and switch it back on and we're back to normal now something else that I find pretty cool is that every time you open up a game this manual setting will pop up where you basically can control the phone settings for the game you want to run so we can tweak with the performance the GPU settings just a bunch of settings so you guys can maximize the performance now if you guys go into GPU settings you guys will see the Snapdragon GPU and if you guys go into custom you guys can just change all like the quality settings so if I just make everything else on low we're going to have much higher FPS and in the performance settings we can do the same thing with the GPU and CPU either on eco balance or rise as you guys can see Rise makes the game on the best performance mode yeah basically just a bunch of settings that you guys can change which is pretty cool since this thing is a gaming phone you could tweak around with the settings so you guys can get the best performance all right so we have fortnite loaded up on this phone and if you guys go into the settings you guys can see it's capped at 90 FPS I think you can only play 120 FPS if you're playing on like a tablet or an iPad but either way 90 FPS this thing honestly feels super super smooth phone screen refresh rate is 120 htz and even running below the refresh rate this thing honestly still feels really really smooth I don't know why but honestly feels a lot smoother than the 90 FPS that we're generating but as you guys can see I kind of do still have my mobile skills with me nothing too crazy I can just do like consistent 90s really easy okay I messed up as I just said that but as you guys can see my skill is still pretty decent obviously I could connect a controller to this phone but I would honestly be a lot worse on controller just because I never played on controller so but I don't think there's a way to connect a keyboard and mouse to this kind of sucks because if you could it honestly would be a pretty decent like budget gaming PC but nonetheless as you guys can see the FPS is actually really stable we're still getting like 90 FPS on the dot but let's check out how it runs in an actual game now okay so yeah in game we're still running a stable 90 FPS as you guys can see the FPS is really stable it doesn't drop below like 70 so the playing experience on the phone isn't too bad it's definitely really smooth like I said I'm not sure what like the resolution is on this phone okay somehow I killed him a lot of my buttons are just like crammed together I don't know what the resolution on this phone is but the quality is also really really bright and it's also really really clear like honestly it might be clearer than my iPhone like the colors and everything just pop super well with this phone oh there's fighting there's fighting there's fighting hold up hold up where you at where you at oh what is going on oh my God oh my God hold up 30 dead he also pushing me hold up Auto fire this Auto fire okay it's not as broken as I thought what happened bro what happened I mean this phone could definitely run fortnite at 120 FPS it's just for some reason is capped at 90 I'm not too sure why but since we're running like a really stable 90 FPS like 120 FPS would be running well with like literally no problems that guy's one shot this guy's one shot this guy's one shot dead 30 bro there we go Squad wipe I made the controls definitely way too big bro I'm touching like a bunch of other stuff laser him laser him where'd he go dead dead let's go all right so far I'm actually feeling a little bit of overheating from the phone I do have the cooling fans all the way to the m feeling the phone a little bit it's getting a little bit warmer and we're literally only like 15 minutes into gaming so I'm not too sure how well the cooling is but by the time we finish testing think fortnite and war zone I'm pretty sure the phone is definitely going to be like overheating or just like super hot hold up where are these guys over here nope oh they're over here dead I got to heal I got to heal where is he what is going on crack dead let's go I might lowkey just rely on my Auto fire I'm doing too much building and these mobile players literally cannot catch up bro they're literally like lost oh my oh my God Auto fire bro they're below me they're below me Auto fire kicking dead dead oh my God bro Auto fire and this aim assist is broken Auto fire and this aim assist is actually [Music] broken drop down Auto fire oh my oh my that's not fair bro I don't I don't think that's fair literally beam that guy we're still running a stable 90 FPS that's actually really really nice cuz I'm pretty sure like your regular phone is definitely going to have like a lot of frame drops once you start like overheating or whatever but you know we got the $800 gaming phone we should be good to go guys crazy he starts building oh no oh I'm having a mobile build battle what the what is what is going on no he literally dipped the fight he literally just built a little bit and gave up bro I literally thought I'm going to get into a build fight on mobile that's crazy wait this guy could build oh I'm scared I'm scared now I'm scared now hold up hold up I'm going just beam them from the top oh my oh my that's broken oh that's broken hello dead let's go yo the aim assist is broken oh this guy's about to kill me oh no no no no no no no no full box full box on mobile hold up take my shotgun out [Music] cracked I literally full blocked this guy on mobile bro I F oh whoa whoa whoa what's trying to heal let's go let's go bro we got like 16 kills and also feeling the phone now this thing is definitely getting a lot warmer but yeah fortnite is definitely easy to run on this phone we're getting a really stable 90 FPS but let's go ahead and test out war zone which definitely should have a lot more frame drops since the game is definitely a lot more consuming okay so now we have War Zone on the phone and War Zone actually runs a pretty stable 90 FPS as well I'm not sure how to actually display the FPS but it definitely is really smooth all right we're Landing control man let's go let's go yeah yeah the game is definitely really like really smooth like we're getting literally like no frame drops whatsoever thought we're going to get a ton of frame drops just because War Zone on PC definitely is like a lot more demanding to run but I guess on mobile it's pretty easy to run as well literally like really similar to fortnite this is my first time playing war zone mobile too so I'm not too sure what I'm oh what the heck let's go get his ass give me back my static how do I pick up my gun all right there we go wait how do I plate up I don't know how to Plate up wait what all I don't know what's going on but we got one kill already pretty nice wait this guy's pushing me again why is this guy pushing me you're dead again why would you push me is war zone Mobile's meta the same as War Zone on PC bro I'm running the static and this thing is honestly pretty op on mobile as well oh my God oh my God the static is op okay yeah the phone is definitely overheating now my hands are definitely feeling a lot more hotter literally we're only 20 minutes into gaming on the phone and War Zone definitely is a lot more harder to run I guess dead let's go since the phone is definitely overheating just because I have war zone now like playing fortnite it was definitely not this hot like literally war zone is making this phone overheat all right let's push prison there should be someone on top of prison my hands are actually burning from this phone holy this thing's overheating I literally have like the coolest option for the fan and everything I don't know why it's overheating like this I guess like mobile FPS games just make your phone over heat a lot more one right here hello Little Red Riding Hood dead dead dead no no no no no get me out get me out get me out steem steem steem where my stem where my stem where's your teammate at where's your teammate at oh there you are oh I'm dead I'm dead oh wao what just happened I don't know how to Plate up that's the problem bro I don't know how to Plate up okay yeah the phone is definitely really hot now holy this thing's burning I'm probably not going to run war zone too long just because holding the phone definitely burns my hand but oh my God this thing is actually overheating like crazy the thing is definitely like burning my hand it's really bad I'm not going to lie oh what the [Music] heck dead I think war zone mobile has a lot of players that connect their controller on here so I don't think most people are playing with like touch screen I hear someone I hear someone hold up I hear someone he's below me oh my God bro the audio is actually pretty nice on phone this guy has freaking oh what the what the what the heck where oh he's right there he's right there teammate kill him teammate kill this guy please no okay I'm actually glad we lost cuz my hands are actually burning from this phone I need to shut this thing off I'm not sure if I could check the temperatures of the fan but this thing is super super hot like literally burning hot okay so overall this phone isn't too bad but it definitely isn't worth the price $800 for a phone is just outrageous bro literally buy a PC at that point

which one has the best gaming PC so I decided to buy a gaming PC from each of them and I set a budget of 1 grand if I go on Tik Tok shop and search up gaming PC they either have extremely expensive PCS which are like 2 and2 Grand or just out of our budget or they just have PCS that are not worth the price at all like they have this one over here that's almost 500 up to $800 and it literally doesn't have a graphics card they also just don't have that many gaming PCs to choose from and any that are under one grand are just not worth the price at all they're like so overpriced I was eventually able to find this PC for almost $900 and you won't believe the specs that it came with for almost one grand now it's time to see what PC's teu has I actually ordered a ton off of teu but they've all been really cheap now I'm actually going to buy one close to 1 grand teu already has a lot more options I can keep on scrolling and they just have a ton of gaming PCs so that's already a good sign okay they actually have a really similar PC the same brand that I ordered off of Tik Tok this one actually cost even $100 less than the Tik Tok shop one and it looks way better and it literally has way better specs and yeah honestly I think I already know my answer teu just has better PCS I actually found a PC from the same brand on teu and it actually looks like it has pretty similar specs but it's like $300 less so this will actually be a really good comparison to see how much better value you can get on teu compared to Tik Tok okay so I'm actually going to order this much cheaper PC off of teu and see how it compares to the Tik Tok one I think I already know which brand has better PCS but I still decided to order both of them and after a few days they both finally arrived so it's only been a few days and both PCS arrived and they literally look kind of the same cuz they're from the same brand already this is a pretty weird gaming PC case here is the PC case and it has actual straps over here on the front they're like legit straps I don't even know what material they're made out of but they they actually are straps like like I can legit lift this PC off with it I don't know how sturdy they are so usually I wouldn't nitpick this kind of stuff but it is not even a glass side panel it literally is like the plastic cheap plastic and it's not even a nice side opening door it literally has four screws I have PC cases like this and they cost like 300 bucks and this was almost one grand yeah you guys can literally see the side panel legit bends like it literally isn't glass at all it's just like cheap plastic this thing is already not looking good I'm going to be using LG's 27in OLED gaming monitor to really push these PCS and see how good they really are I've been using LG's monitor in almost every single video for a year now because of the amazing quality you get since its OLED and QHD but you also get amazing performance because it's 240 HZ and has a 0.03 millisecond response time not only that but this is actually the brightest OLED panel on the market thanks to LG's W OLED panel and MLA plus technology the reason I actually really do love this monitor is because it gives me 100% color accuracy so it looks amazing when I'm playing games and even better when I'm actually watching videos or even movies this monitor is just so good I just feel completely immersed in whatever I'm doing one of the biggest advantages you get with an OLED panel like this one is that it doesn't matter if it's really bright or really dark you get amazing colors regardless but that's not all you get amazing colors on this monitor really good performance and even better quality because it's actually 1440p 1440p is actually two times better than 1080p because it has double the amount of pixels LG also provides you with a 2-year warranty on the OLED this monitor will be on a Black Friday sale from the 21st of November all the way to December 2nd it's seriously the best time to go check one of these out because you're saving the most amount of money and I legit own four of them so I absolutely love them make sure to check it out with the first link in the description or pin comment and thank you so much to LG for sponsoring this video again if you're interested in this monitor make sure to check it out because they're actually having a Black Friday sale going on right now all this packaging is just so the PC doesn't have any like rattling as it's shipping inside the PC actually looks pretty decent the PC case I don't know what material it is but it literally feels extremely light just like one of those really cheap PCS I usually get it's just pretty underwhelming for 1 grand I mean not all PCS at this price have an AO but you literally have an air cooler I don't know if you can see but you only have one stick of RAM and you guessed it it's only 8 gig you're spending almost 1K that's crazy what you guys really want to know is the actual GPU and CPU inside of here so you have an RTX 260 and you have a core i59 9400f don't get me wrong I think we'll be able to get 240 FPS on low settings 1080p but for one grand you could literally build this PC for like 500 bucks it's just super super overpriced and not worth it at all there were some other things that came with the PC I think it's just like a bunch of manuals here it looks like the power cord and I think these are actually like network adapters or something and then this thing is like a really weird looking HDMI I don't know why it kind of looks like that because it the head of it is actually super long but I don't know so yeah you can literally see this thing is literally like it's not even glass this thing is so cheap honestly feels such a budget PC even though it was opposite of a budget a lot of people don't even have gaming PCs and if they do there a lot of people have PCS less than 1K so I'm just trying to save you guys this PC is already not worth it let's actually try and take a look at how the PC looks when it's turned on it looks like you have three fans over here on the front probably 100 20 mm and then you got obviously one on the actual cooler you got another one here and then there is one kind of hiding over here on the top honestly it just looks pretty decent it's not my favorite looking PC but it doesn't look bad it's just the specs inside of this thing not worth it now it's time to see how this PC compares to this Teemu PC and like I said the boxes legit look the exact same so I guess the straps on that PC case were actually useful a bunch of stuff is probably going to fall out hopefully I don't break anything all right so it already looks looks like pretty much the exact same stuff but of course the PC case is actually a little different here is the PC case and honestly it's it's glass I this is the one I actually like a lot more this one's way cheaper and it actually is glass I still don't really like the mechanism where you have to take all four screws out I wish it was like a opening door or even one that had the screws hiding in the back so it actually has like a lot of tint on it but yeah as you guys can see I'm not even going to try and like bend it but it literally is like glass it's like straight up it actually is good quality so that's already a good thing and this PC was legit like 2/3 the price of the other one First Impressions the cables do look a little bit worse inside of here and the fans and AIO they just don't look as good you don't have an RGB one these ones are kind of just look like cheaper fans they do have one hiding on the top oh they actually have two hiding on the top there and then three 120 mm ones over on this side what's actually important though are the specs inside of here so you actually surprisingly get 16 GB of RAM in here an RX 6600 and for the CPU I actually have an AMD ryzen R5 4500 which I've actually never had so I'm curious to try it out this PC doesn't really have the specs that much better than the last one but they're really similar and this one's like $300 or $400 less which is a huge price difference again you basically have the exact same things you have an HDMI cable power cable and the actual two antennas for the Wi-Fi cuz the motherboard doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi that's usually something that's common on like cheaper PCS like this and I forgot to mention both of these PCS actually are using a 450 W power supply all right let's just make sure it actually turns on okay perfect I like this one way more you can actually see the RGB fans over on the front it's a full glass panel over here on the front not only the side you have two more up on the top here and then you have one in the back so I actually like this one way more unfortunately the actual CPU Cooler isn't RGB I think that would have been a nice touch I mean aesthetically I think this PC literally looks better than the other one that was more expensive it feels better quality they're actually using glass the most important thing though is the performance now it's time to finally put these PCS to the test to see which one actually performs better so I loaded up fortnite on performance mode with the Tik Tok PC and went into creative first so we're running 1080p performance mode all low settings on the Tik Tock shop PC I have the FPS on unlimited but we're sitting right below 240 FPS but when I start building you guys can see it starts to get really laggy it just fully freezes like we're getting bottlenecked like crazy the graphics card is pretty decent you see now it got stable it gets really laggy and then it like gets fine it seems that it actually is now getting stable I'm just doing a bunch of edits it's actually been being pretty stable around 160 FPS over there at the top overall it seems to do pretty good but it's really easy for feces to run in here because it's literally only creative so let's actually step it up a little bit this is where the FPS usually tanks the most it's when you're skydiving but it just dipped a little bit but now we're at around 150 so pretty good okay it's a little bit more inconsistent it's around 100 right now but it kind of is a little bit laggy like when I'm moving around a lot this performance is not good for that price it should easily be getting 240 FPS okay this guy's literally 1 HP yep okay so he was just literally going to SMG spam me bro I'm just going to push this guy I'm literally 1 HP though if I die to this bot I actually have to quit wa where didd he go oh my I'm lagging it's lagging so bad look it just fully crashed this PC is really really bad for the price you're paying okay there we go if that guy killed me that would have been so unlucky I mean I'm kind of shambles I have no shield look it just fully lagged it's still fully Frozen yo and you're paying almost 1K for that that is crazy bro I think a lot of it honestly just has to do with the ram if I'm being honest I think the ram is probably one of the biggest things holding it back cuz an RTX 2060 is a budget GPU um in 2024 but it's not terrible okay I hear someone pushing me I think this is guy was trying to fight earlier y I'm just going to spray him you're Lally one okay there we go wait this kid is so weird why are you trying to RPG me bro dude what okay is he in my box oh yeah he is one HP dead obviously for someone that's never had a PC this is like way better than a console still but you definitely probably have to Game On like 720p if you want really consistent performance pc just be lagging too much and it's like I don't know bro I just don't feel confident to actually take like a build fight it like see it's at 150 160 as soon as I start actually building bro this thing tanks to like a 100 or something bro okay I think I heard some fighting going on here dude these guys are like so sweaty like actually it's insane that guy's definitely like lowkey kind of a sweat I can just see how he's building he's building like a tryhard bro he's been killing everyone in lobby I'm going to just kill him real quick before the other kid comes bro let me kill you before the other kid comes oh my of course my Ping's not good enough 25 Ping's not good enough now oh my gosh I legit feel like I can't build fast cuz it's so laggy what he's 1 HP he's 1 HP I don't even care if the other kid kills him just kill him bro he's literally 1 HP I think I hear the other guy coming yep and we're getting fully blown up I can't edit I can't edit my cone that's literally not my cone oh my gosh and it's so laggy this guy is actually zero ping zero ping oh my gosh I'm just holding my wall and I can't place the Tik Tok PC did get some decent performance but for one grand it was really not that good so now it's finally time to move on to the Teemu PC and see if it's actually better so I'm now on creative in performance mode and it seems like the performance is pretty much the exact same but remember this PC is like 23 almost even half the price of the Tik Tok shop one actually I already think the FPS is even more consistent on this it hasn't had one big frame drop I'm actually just waiting for that to happen right now but it's actually been way more consistent okay there we finally got one big frame drop but it actually feels a lot better here but at the same time it is only creative so I can't really judge it to much until we actually go in game and see how much fps it gets we're already getting around 150 to 100 FPS it seems a little bit in consistent but it definitely is more consistent than the last PC okay this guy what is he doing okay that was definitely an AI okay there's like two people pushing me bro oh my so we're checking nades in here wait they're ready fighting I want a third party bro give me this wall fortnite please there we go oh my what were you trying to do buddy what's this guy doing bro yep dead easy bro oh he had a chug chug I got him at the perfect time I'm playing way better on this though we're getting almost 200 like I said on the exact same settings this PC for a fraction of the price teu PC is way better please don't tell me I regret doing this no way this kid's camping bro oh he's in the car he's in the car no he's not what no actually where is this kid bro I'm actually scared where is this kid I just saw him this guy's literally camping somewhere oh my gosh you're so weird bro no way come on the car is literally 1 HP come on fortnite bro this guy is so weird why is he camping like that dude there we go instantly pushing that come on give me that full boxed oh my gosh get clipped yeah I like this PC way better I'm not going to even lie the T PC is actually crushing the Tik Tok shop PC it's it's like not even a challenge if I spent the same amount of money dude it would not even be close at all this is already way more consistent I think it just has to come down to the ram is like the biggest thing though I think that's what kind of contributed to it the most this guy sucks yep one HP one HP come on there we go I'm just trying to push like everyone I see dude we could get like 10 kills here oh wait there's actually a kid here no way no oh my this kid sucks though oh my gosh this guy's not good where are you oh he's in my box oh my gosh my aim sucks yo why is he not fighting why are they not fighting bro these kid are like actually camping oh wait no they're fighting right now oh it's the white skin he just killed them with a drum gun yep no why is he waiting for that I I did not know he was going to be waiting for that I still beat that kid if that kid killed me I would have actually been mad I'm sure you guys can tell from the gameplay I literally just did better that game this PC is way better both the PCS are linked down below but I think it's pretty safe to say the teu PC is way better if you're watching the video right now though you're already at the end of the video so you had to have enjoyed it so a sub is greatly appreciated one out of five of you guys are actually only subbed so there's so many of you guys that are not subbed at all if you guys want to use the same setup as me Miss laabs make sure to check it out we have mouse pads keyboard cables and more but more importantly remember Jesus loves you that's about it God bless

advertisers by visiting store Gamers nexus.net welcome back to the best of Roundup series we do these every year at the end of the year for multiple different component categories we have best cases coming up and a couple of others too uh we run these to just kind of get a quick recap of everything and help get people up to speed efficiently we know that a lot of you only really check in on computer parts every couple years or so when you build a new system so this series should help you quickly identify what's available what's good and then you can use it as a launching point to dig deeper from there and research the parts that interest you the most for your use case as you find cvws that are interested in this video we'll link their original reviews below there might be newer data available there is in most cases but that'll give you the sort of most in-depth version of what we have to offer for each of those CPUs and then we'll also have the usual links to the retailers they are typically affiliate links in the description below as well as usual these roundups don't go as charts heavy as our reviews so if you want all the charts you should check some of the reviews we have like 40 minute ones out these are meant to be more quick and simple and uh go over the key highlights with some charts to just reinforce the main points as we go so uh there's a lot to get into today we have a written version that'll go up on the website shortly if you want that recap but for now let's get into it the first award category is for the best overall CPU for 2024 this one goes to the AMD ryzen 7 9800 x3d CPU which also takes our best gaming CPU category later we'll save the gaming heavy discussion for this CPU for that category in a little bit the 9800 x2d gets best overall for a few other key reasons first its $480 price makes it a better buy than several of the other high-end CPUs that have come out recently including the Intel 285k at its staggering $630 launch pricing secondly the 9800 XD manages chart topping gaming performance which again will save for our best gaming category while also managing overall acceptable production and workstation application performance it's not the best in these workloads but it's still capable in blender the 9800 XD doesn't benefit from its extra cash but still manages to at least outperform the lower power budget Zen 5 component on that are eight cores and fewer like the 9700x in Photoshop the 9800 X 3D actually is the best and ended up as the top performer here Photoshop likes Zen 5 in general from what we've tested so far and benefits from its architectural changes at least via the Puget suite and that really shows with the 9800 x3d the 9800 x3d is also an excellent overclocker and it's fully unlocked something that wasn't true for the prior x2d Parts it's such a good OC part that we even took it to stream to use liquid nitrogen and overclocked it atus 140° C yielding some ridiculous performance scaling in real games that we might not have expected previously AMD moved to the cache closer to the substrate with the core complex getting cores right against the inside of the integrated heat spreader for this generation this helped improve the thermal situation which also is what gives AMD clock headro amd's N5 is ground up built for x3d this time and it shows it's also a single CCD part which keeps things as simple as possible to set up we already know the 9800 X is the K of gaming but it's these other reasons that make it the best overall CPU for 2024 we can highly recommend this one for new high-end gaming Focus builds especially but it's an overall competent performer where needed in workstation the next award is for the most balanced CPU which is a category we've used for years to ensure credit is given to CPUs that perform well both in workstation or production applications and in gaming this weighs all aspects of GN reviews so it considers price gaming performance efficiency production performance and it's kind of meant for someone who does some gaming but also a good amount of work on their computer maybe you're a video editor and every now and then you play games on the same system we're giving this to the AMD R 979x primarily secondarily to the 14900 K as a runner up now that its price has dropped the 750x lands here because its price has come down so the 950x is more expensive the 14900 K is on here as a secondary Choice rather than sort of tied for first because its poor handling of its instability issues caused us to question the comp's successful resolution of all its problems and second Intel's efficiency is through the floor and its power is through the roof on this part so just can't compete there with the 750x currently the 750x has fallen to $480 and under with the 149 herk and now at $440 at the time we're writing this these CPUs both land on this list for their impressive workstation and production application performance balancing good enough gaming with high throughput performance in use cases like file compression and decompression rendering or code compile and Adobe applications like premiere for video editing now the 285k had some impressive results in production but it just has so many other faults and its price is so high that it doesn't get a place here the 9800 x3d is a great CPU but its limited core count is a significant disadvantage in these non-gaming tests We Run The 795x particularly with Eco Mode enabled has some of the best efficiency we've seen in RCP efficiency charts the thread Ripper Parts can outperform due to their incredible performance but for a balance of price and performance The 750x Remains strong the 950x does well in the same categories but it's significantly more expensive at least right now the 149 hric doesn't do well in efficiency it's actually one of the least efficient we've looked at but its gaming performance is a little higher in most places than the 750x and in production tests it tends to trade places with the 7950 x with the new lower price it is worth a second look it's just the used market for these has been turned into a minefield with the stability issue Parts potentially getting dumped secondhand But ultimately the 750x has the advantage of being on a platform that'll live for many more years and you may one day be looking at your own best upgrade CPU category in our 2027 or 2028 Roundup for am5 and that's the advantage AMD holds here next up is the award for the best gaming CPU this one's extremely simple we're strictly looking for the best possible gaming performance and ignoring all other factors including cost this is a numbers based category for rate is pretty simple fortunately the best gaming CPUs these days are often cheaper than their non-gaming Flagship counterparts the AMD ryzen 7 9800 XD gets the award this year and at $480 it's a clean sweep of the gaming charts it isn't even close in some situations to other CPUs surpassing even last year's winner the 7800 x3d by sometimes large margins we have several games in the 16% range a lot of them in the 8 to 10% range but overall very strong uplift let's go by the numbers for this numbers-based award from our 7600 X 3D review you can see how AMD has completely taken over the top of the gaming charts the 9800 x2d has an incredible lead in balers Gate 3 up at 160 FPS average to the 7800 x2d is at 126 we spent some time in our 9800 x2d review explaining and exploring this one because the 26.9% uplift was uncharacteristic ultimately it replicated and we had data to support the finding Dragon's Dogma 2 is a 2024 title that's extremely heavy on the CPU this one had another breakout success where the 9800 xvd doesn't even take a second to identify with how it breaks away from the rest of the stack the CPU holds a 16% lead over the 7800 x3d which was already the best gaming part before that Intel isn't even Clos here f124 also has the 9800 x2d advantaged even though it's becoming limited by other components it still holds a lead here Dawn tril is another like this gains are lower but everpresent Starfield posted an impressive uplift for the 9800 x3d as well jumping to 169 FPS average from 145 on the 7800 x2d which was already a good result frame time pacing is overall strong with the 9800 x2d too there are some categories where its 1% and. 1% lows improve disproportionately from the average which is another great result to see overall the 9800 x3d easily takes our best gaming CPU of the Year award for 2024 following up a strong show in from the 7800 x2d before it next up is the award for best upgrade CPU a category we added 2 years ago this is the best CPU that can drop into a prior generation of motherboards in socket upgrades are great for consumers they reduce wasteful spending on more boards and RAM that might not be needed and they also reduce E-Waste they also keep builds more affordable this year the AMD R 75700 x2d easily secures the award the preceding 5800 x2d got best upgrade last year but it has since largely disappeared as a new inbox purchase and its price has gone up the 5700 x2d has taken its place commonly available between a shockingly low 180 bucks to a more typical $230 the 5700 x2d is able to achieve most of the performance of the 5800 x2d CPU when looking at gaming charts typically it's within 10 percentage points often fewer the 5800 xvd benefits from a higher frequency though so there are some situations where you'll see the 5700 x3d dip down the charts one example is Final Fantasy 14 Dawn Trail where in The Benchmark the 5700 XD ran at a frame rate that gave the 5800 XD an advantage of 11% this is one of the highest Deltas we saw in gaming between the two parts the 5600 x2d even outperforms the 5700 x2d in Final Fantasy specifically which sometimes confuses people the 5600 x may have fewer cores but its frequency is 300 MHz higher both are 105 watt TDP parts so reducing the core count means that more power budget on the 56 is available for the clocks generally speaking though the 5700 x3d is the better perform between the two in balers Gate 3 we saw the 57 x3d just behind the 76 x3d and about 10 FPS behind the 5800 X2 that's an incredible rank for a part that's around $230 especially considering it's outperforming a $630 285k or a $440 4900 K depending on when you watch this video because that price keeps changing broadly speaking the 5700x 2D's price is wild and the fact that am4 boards exist in high quantities on the used Market also makes it a good consideration for even a used new build because you might have a lower cost to entry the CPU can sock it into am4 boards if you already have an am4 board from an old ryzen build it's likely that a bios update will allow it to support the 5700 x3d some older boards especially from the first gen of ryzen are spotty on their support so check the motherboard CPU support list to be sure we're going to give a runnerup mention to the 14700 K which is about $350 these days if you're on an alder Lake 12 600k or something this might make sense upgrade to in socket just check to make sure your motherboard's actually compatible with it you need to update BIOS and also make sure the vrm is capable of the higher heat load this is a short one this award is for the most efficient CPU we've tested this year and it goes to amd's somewhat obscure ryzen 57600 x3d this part is sold in micro seters in the US and from what our European viewers have told us sparingly in some European retailers it's not widely available but when it is available it seems to be around $300 in gameing workloads at the 7600 x3d had impressively efficient results its power consumption was just 43 watts in our balers Gate 3 test which allowed it to run at 2.7 FPS per watt and outrank even the 9800 xvd and 7800 xvd in efficiency both of which were impressive already in Dawn tril we saw chart breaking results that required us to adjust our chart axis the 7600 XD outed everyone for efficiency there the CPU is somewhat rare but it's combination of lower TDP and X3 on Zen 4 is what enables this performance definitely an impressively efficient part and we want to encourage more CPUs like this it's just too bad about the somewhat limited Supply if this CPU were more widely available we probably would have selected it for our best mid-range CPU category as well but we needed something widely available and a little cheaper so speaking of here's that category next the next award is for the best mid-range CPU this lineup is lacking in $150 to $200 parts so far and we're looking for something that that's overall balanced at this price range considerations for this category would include amd's R5 7600 NX at 198 bucks and benefiting from a modern am5 platform Intel's 14400 F I5 CPU or 13400 F neither of which make much sense at their prices and Intel's i7 12700 KF at 190 bucks we're giving this award to the i7 12700 KF which feels weird since it's from 2021 but the modern Market means prior generation parts are persisting longer than typical above $200 and with a gaming only build the 5700 x3d might make more sense but the 12700 KF gives a great balance of workstation performance and gaming performance and it has a big benefit of not being on Intel's plagued architectures this was the one that skated by in gaming the 12700 KF typically lands alongside the Intel 245k which is currently $320 so a big jump up from the 190 of the 12700 KF or AMD is50 700x 3D 5600x or 7700x and 9700x parts the 5700x 3D is more gaming focused and tends to be a little more expensive the 7700x is frequently more expensive and the 9700x is 320 to 350 bucks if not more depending on where and when you look in production the 12700 KF is similar to an R7 7700x or 9700x in many cases it outperforms most of the x3d parts thanks to its core count and it equates Intel's 14600 K or 45k the 245k does well in our production tests when compared to the 12700 KF despite its shortcomings overall just happens to be more expensive it's weird to put a CPU this old on the list and we've already put CPUs around this era from am4 on the list but AMD and Intel really haven't had a lot of activity below $200 for a few years now except for things like the 7600 which is just below 200 but it's still technically a prior generation so the Market's changed a bit for how it behaved we'll keep this one short this is for the best high-end desktop CPU for the second year in a row mostly because there aren't any Replacements yet this is going to AMD is threaded for 79 70x we liked the 7980x but its super high core count is more limited in use case if you need 64 cores you probably know it and it's like $5,000 so kind of a different class we found the 79 70x still expensive uh to be an excellent balance at least in production workloads that we use in our office it's a 32 core part it's not as Extreme as the 7980 and it did great in our testing with Adobe Premiere it has a ton of IO capabilities with extra pcie lanes that open up storage options for True sort of localized workstation class computers and along with other threader Parts it had some of the best efficiency results we' presented in those specific production workloads that utilize the cores it also performed especially well in our spec workstation benchmarks previously to the point that the 7950 X wasn't close in some comparisons but for now we'd advise waiting on a purchase in this category in general if you can sounds like the beginning of next year will be pretty busy for everybody and current rumors about a 9950 x3d or possible Replacements in HDT may be a reason to pay attention there as well and hold off next up is the best gaming CPU under $100 this one's pretty self-explanatory this goes to a split because the price is variable the r 55600 the I3 1300f or I3 12100 F all get attention here once again multiple years in the running the I3 1200f from Intel ends up on the list but unlike last year the i31 1300f has also Fallen below $100 the R5 5600 non X ends up on this list as well with all three CPUs taken this category out of these three CPUs the amdr 55600 is the best overall balance and performer in most categories the only reason to exclude it in favor of the i3s is if it's over $100 when you check this that is the criteria here but right now there are OEM CPU only listings for $99.99 which technically qualifies for the list value goes down at its other common Mark of 120 bucks though and it falls off the list at that point the 12100 f is $77 which would be crazy if it weren't 2 years old the I3 13100 f is $80 neither of these F SKS have igps which is why they're cheap when we looked at the I3 1300f last year we found that the 1300f frequently outperformed the R5 5500 with a significant percentage Advantage the 5500 in our opinions is not good enough to consider it's slightly more expensive than the 1300f but it's worse and both are on dead platforms anyway for gaming looking at our data from last year when we had all three of these CPUs on the charts the R5 5600 regularly outperformed the 13100 F and 12100 F in fact it was even over the 12400 in some tests if you can find it under $100 the 5600 makes a lot of sense for this category but even a few bucks over it it's not bad but where the I3 12100 F and 13100 f are 20 plus dollar Che cheaper and where the strictest possible budgets exist and you just simply can't go higher for Price they're still capable performers we recently ran the 12100 F again and found that it was capable in every game we tested with one exception of extremely spotty frame times in our balers Gate 3 test the core and thread count is showing its age here it's impressive how much these three CPS are capable of they're still playing games and mostly without major frame pacing issues it's just unfortunate that Intel and AMD haven't really launched anything new into this market for such a long time now the last category is for the biggest disappointment Intel gets this one for the second year running 2022 saw it going to AMD for the 4500 so it's been a bit of an upset where Intel has taken the ball from AMD this year's disappointment though puts all other ones into perspective the 13th and 14th gen stability issues this year get the award reminding us that where other disappointments simply suck there's always room to suck more the 13th and 14th gen CPUs experienc a mix of problems including Fab level oxidation defects confirmed by Intel all the way up to wider scale stability issues relating to voltage and micro code Intel fumbled the handling of this and lost consumer confidence dragging its feet on a response and then trying to craft a careful narrative when it finally did respond this was followed up by the ultra 200 series which went back to Simply being a disappointing set of products rather than a truly catastrophic and impressive failure but this industry needs Intel and AMD to both compete head-to-head Intel of the past showed us what happens when the market has only one dominating vendor back in the 14 nanometer Plus+ Plus+ plus days and Nvidia and gpus shows us maybe a glimpse of a similar future it's just not the job of consumers to prop up a company that sells subpar products you don't need to Kickstart Intel or in the case of the disappointment this year with a 13th and 14th gen it's not your job to buy products that had a potential Time Bomb failure baked in in the very least though Intel has at least eventually and finally responded with micro code patches that they say have fixed the issue it's just we won't fully know for a while yet because this is a time-based issue pricing today is the giant variable at the end of all this it moves around all the time and especially as we approach Black Friday which is America's number one holiday it's when we celebrate complete consumerism and Chaos so uh as that approaches of course the prices are going to change here all this is based on the price at the time we wrote the video but hopefully you have enough information here to sort of make some decisions even as those numbers move around it's always a little weird when some of the parts are prior generation components but if they're the best parts for that price or for that use case it doesn't really matter how old they are uh except for one factor which is the potential upgradeability so the older the platform is if you're buying it to am4 today it feels a little bad only because uh it's it's the end of the line I mean if you're buying a 5700 x3d it doesn't get much better than that for am4 except a 5800 x3d and that upgrade wouldn't make sense or 550x or something in production uh so that's the only sort of downside of buying into those older ones that's major other than things like modernized iio support and all that we cover all that in our reviews not going to go over it as in- depth here the biggest area that's lacking right now in CPUs is the sub $100 Market it's just it's aging with the 12100 f the 13100 half the r 55600 is only rarely sub $100 right now when we're checking before of course this video goes live but it would become the go-to choice for us if it ever solidifies in that sub $100 range sub2 200 has better options but it's still mostly older components that's it for this Roundup though hopefully that helps get you up to speed check back for best cases we didn't get to do a full usual best cases Roundup last year because we were overhauling our test methodology but we can this year really excited about that one I'm working on that with Patrick and uh we love working on these in general because they're a ton of fun to work back through the components see how they did and it also helps just remind us that in spite of all of the vendors hardest work assuring us that there will be another disappointment build at the end of the year uh there are parts that are not disappointing and actually did pretty well so it's nice to just have that reminder for the positive launches more of

I took the plunge and bought the REDMAGIC 9S Pro to see if gaming phones are still worth it in 2024. Despite some impressive specs and benchmarks, I discovered some major drawbacks that make me question the whole concept of gaming phones. This is why I think you're better off with a regular flagship or dedicated handheld for gaming.

Because if you're like me, you've seen ads and ads
and ads for this phone all over the place. Instead I said, no thank you sponsorship. And yes, I will instead give you $900, and buy one for myself. Because I'm incredibly curious. Is anyone really meant to buy a gaming phone in 2024? I mean, I get it. A few years ago, when like the first Razer Phone came out, there's a real sales pitch to buy a gaming phone, but fast forward to today, and any reasonable flagship is gonna have the exact same chip. It's gonna have vapor chamber cooling, a big battery. And the problem is that, typically gaming phones
have major downsides. You're gonna have subpar cameras, poor software support, a huge chunky build. So today, let's take a look at this REDMAGIC 9S Pro, which has taken over my subscription feed, to see is this actually worth it. Now, while I did pay $900 for this phone, I will say that you can get it cheaper if you buy it directly
from the REDMAGIC site. So I bought on Amazon, and for some reason on Amazon, it is a $100 more expensive than it is on the REDMAGIC site. Okay. I'm so curious. I've seen so many ads of this thing, it looks kind of cool. This is Cyclone colorway and it supposedly has a transparent back. It does feel pretty nice. We've got a headphone jack on top. Oh my god, a headphone jack? All right. Wait a minute. I was about to like make fun of this thing for being all dumb and stuff, but actually, that's pretty good. Let me give you some of the sales pitch on why supposedly this makes sense. So one of the first things they claim is that it is cheaper than a traditional flagship phone, and that is true. So this is the $800 version on the REDMAGIC site. You can get a $650 version, which just has less RAM and less storage. It also has active cooling. So if you look on the side here, you'll see a little vent. So apparently there's a
very tiny 22,000 RPM fan that will help to cool off the device. In fact, you actually can see it slightly on the inside of this side. Oh, actually no, I think, wait. Oh, I thought that was a camera. That's actually the fan itself. Oh. That's actually kind of a cool design. So you actually can see two cameras, and you got the the fan, which spins. Well, the other pitch is battery life. So this has a quite enormous 6500mAh battery. I will say that's just cool. That's just a significantly bigger battery than pretty much any
regular flagship out there. I am completely unsure of what to think about this. So we do have a case in the box as well as well, the REDMAGIC girl. She looks like she's gonna mess you up. And a power brick. A power brick in a phone? What? Sit down. It's 2017 all over again. Have you heard about the latest REDMAGIC phone? - Oh my gosh. That actually looks kind of sick. (laughs) Hit the fan button. (chuckles) Fan lights up. (laughs) - That is crazy. So there's a feature that I've not tried yet. I was waiting for you. - Okay. - Give me a hand with it. - All right. - Okay, so hit Super Base. - Okay.
- And then press on Mora. - Oh god, I already know
where this is going. - I don't know what this is, but it wants me to choose
my identity for Mora. - Oh my gosh. Okay. - I mean normally you
go on the Play Store, and seek this out, but this just comes with your... - Hello. - Hi. (laughs) Okay. - Oh no. No. - Oh, you got different skins. - Here's the thumbnail one. Okay, all right. (laughs) All right, that's enough. That's enough of that. All right. Have fun with your REDMAGIC. I will grab this phone
when you are done with it. - For obvious reasons. - For very obvious reasons. - [Mora] Earthquake. Hurry up, Commander. So I've been using the REDMAGIC for a little bit and I've
got a lot of thoughts. But first and foremost, let's actually play some games because that's really
what this is designed for, not games with Mora. Sorry, Mora, - [Mora] That's not allowed. - Okay, anyway. One of the advantages of a gaming phone specifically with this REDMAGIC is that it does have the triggers on the top, which is nice because you don't always
need a controller. I'm gonna jump into COD Mobile, which is one of I think the better games to
demonstrate how this works. Now the way these triggers work, you just have to swipe in from the side, and you can enable it via the gaming mode. And what happens is, they essentially will tap buttons on the screen for you. So it really just emulates if you just like touch the bottom left or bottom right, you can kind of adjust it. The advantage there is that, certainly for like games that have like shooting involved, it's a lot easier because you don't have to move your thumbs as much. You can actually use it a little bit like a regular controller. So you can see here with the triggers, if I tap left, it's going down to my sight, and if I tap right, I can shoot. The experience is good I will certainly say. The fluidity of running this on like high settings and like
you know, 120 FPS or more. Like, this is good, this feels nice. If I can say some positive things about this first, this is a gaming phone, and it does feel good as a gaming phone. You know, like yes, it's a little bit on
the bigger chunkier side when it's in your pocket, but when you hold it in your hands, it feels nice. That fan is spinning, and there's certainly
airflow that goes through, but it's not loud. I've got on the auto mode, you can manually set it to like turbo mode, but to me, even when the fans crank at 100%, it's not that loud. For normal gaming, this is solid. But outside of the triggers, I'll say that this experience isn't really that different than something like using a Galaxy S24 where you really see the advantage of a gaming smartphone
is in the benchmarks. So I'm going to start a stress test on both phones, and we'll talk a little bit about the performance that you're gonna get. So for context, when you
look at the marketing for the REDMAGIC, it is very clear that they want this to be the most powerful
gaming phone you can buy. And if you look at the benchmarks, you actually will see
that that is largely true. So we've run this REDMAGIC against few other phones, mostly the S24 Ultra, but also like the iPhone 15 Pro, and the OnePlus 12. And this does score higher than any of those other phones, generally speaking. Let me remind you my friends, this is not a sponsored video. I bought this REDMAGIC with my own money, and therefore I have
the freedom to tell you that these numbers are, I'll be generous and say, a little bit misleading. So with our S24 strapped to the REDMAGIC Cooler 5 Pro, what you're gonna see here is that an external cooler will get you almost the exact same score. So one of the things I will say, is that they allow, like when the REDMAGIC is really cranking, yes it has a fan. Yes, that is able to
keep the processor cool, but the frame of the phone gets incredibly hot to the point where when you're running this benchmark for like 10 minutes, it's like hotter than I want to touch. Like it is incredibly, incredibly warm, and that's like the
whole frame of the phone in the back. Like it just, it feels like REDMAGIC don't care about the skin temperatures. They don't care about you
being able to touch it. They just let that thing run. Whereas with the S24 Ultra, I'm running it with a cooler right now, but even without the cooler, it never gets that hot. They just throttle the performance back before it gets uncomfortable. Then you might think that with a 65 00mAh battery, that you would get great battery life with the REDMAGIC. And that's largely true, except when you really tax it. So if you are running something like this, which is the 3DMark
Steel Nomad stress test, it is a 20 minute full
100% load on the phone. The S24 in that 20 minutes burns 11% of its battery, but the REDMAGIC burns 18% and keep in mind, that's 18% of a much larger battery to begin with. It's really clear that to get that, you know, 10, 11, 12, 13% extra performance
when it comes to 3DMark, they're throwing a lot more power at between the LEDs, the fan, and just cranking voltage through that Snapdragon. Now, I wanna put a little
caveat on all of this. We're talking benchmarks right now. No game pushes these phones this hard. They just don't, right? I mean, this is an incredibly graphically demanding game. You're getting like 12 FPS like the phones are absolutely doing everything they can, but I do think it's just worth considering that to get that absolute max performance out of the REDMAGIC, there is some major downsides. You might see the number and go, ""Oh, it's 30% faster in Antutu."" But like sure, and it also gonna burn your hands, and your battery's gonna drain faster than an S24 Ultra. So is that worth it? When you look at the
REDMAGIC as a gaming phone, there's a lot to break down. First up, we've gotta
talk about that display because honestly it is pretty solid. We're looking at a 6.8 inch OLED panel that's bright. Get up to 1,600 nits, and has pretty minimal bezels, especially for a gaming phone. Now, it might only have
a 120 hertz refresh rate, which sure you could easily point out that the ROG Phone 8, has a 165 hertz display. Here's the thing, in real world usage, that difference is
pretty much non-existent. Now I will say that the LEDs that are in the triggers are kind of neat, but it's like cool for like five minutes. I just don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to my waifu gaming phone. (laughs and giggles) - Captain. Stop, stop. - I surrendered. - I surrendered. You have some hand sanitizer? I don't know the last time I cringed this hard in a video, it was, but it was at least a few weeks ago. It's been maybe even a month or two. - [Mora] Was that an earthquake? Ooh. It was just a Captain's prank. - Moving on. Where was I? Performance, benchmarks, numbers. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Other things I'm maybe
not like a huge fan of, I don't like the power button mostly because it's really tiny, and it's tucked right
above the gaming slider, which takes some getting used to. More often than not, I find myself when I'm trying to unlock the phone, finding the slider and
then moving my finger up, like it just feels a
little bit unnecessary. Now on the audio front, it is nice to find a headphone jack. It's a very pleasant surprise in 2024. That being said, I would've liked to also see a second USB-C port, like the ROG Phone, but that's not too bad. The main thing is, well, it does have quite good speakers so they get plenty loud. There's a good amount of
separation and clarity. But the problem is that because the grills are so small, and the kind of oddly shaped, I find myself that most
time when I'm gaming, my fingers are covering one or both of the speakers, which just feels like a little bit of an oversight. Performance wise, the REDMAGIC 9S Pro is definitely packing
some serious hardware with the slightly overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inside paired
with 16 gigabytes of RAM in my model. Although the base model does have only 12 gigs of RAM, but boy does it feel like REDMAGIC are really pushing this
chip to its limits. It's like they looked at the idea of the you know, you look in the dictionary for like thermal throttling and safeguards and go, ""Nah, nah, nah, we don't need any of that."" Now, to be fair, I don't wanna oversell the battery as being bad or anything like that. If you are a little bit more conservative with your settings, and not just doing
benchmarks all the time, you can easily get a full day of use with some moderate gaming, and when you do need to charge up the 80 watt charging is legit. Still though, I just can't
help shake the feeling that REDMAGIC are playing a little fast, and loose with power management. It's great for benchmark numbers, and mostly avoiding throttling. It does a good job, but you just, it's hot, man. It just feels like
they're cranking this chip beyond it's sort of ideal window. Now let's talk about the real elephant in the room, the software. It's, what's the word? Not great. It's ah, okay. Here's the thing. Like I don't want to unfairly point out some of the smaller things that don't matter, right? Like of course there are some rough edges, and things like typos that are pretty much everywhere, including one that I could not forgive, screenshot it so you can see it. They couldn't decide on how to capitalize their own REDMAGIC branding. Like there's like one line, it's like a lowercase M, and then just... Imagine Samsung just spelling randomly in one of their settings. Sam, space, sung. I would return it on the spot, but the real kicker is
the update situation. According to REDMAGIC t hemselves, and I quote, ""We do regular updates
every one to two months for two plus years with at least one Android OS update. Let me reiterate. They promised a minimum of one major update in 2024, when Samsung are out here promising seven years of not just updates, but full Android OS updates for the S24 lineup. To me, this is unacceptable. Full stop. It's like REDMAGIC, they're stuck in 2015 while the rest of the
industry has moved on. Now, I guess you could argue that hardcore gamers
don't care about updates, but like we're talking about like security patches, bug fixes, new features. I mean, even if they do give you the full two plus years that they may be able to reach, and that's not for full updates. Just like for like software updates for like the small things like security, this stuff matters when you want to use it as a daily driver. I mean, you're spending a lot of money on this phone. I want it to actually get updates in a timely fashion for more than a year or two. That's just, that's not okay. You also won't be surprised to learn that the cameras are passable, I guess? It's just clear that they've cut corners for budget's sake here. Now, while the main
shooter isn't terrible, it is a clear step down from what you would expect with a proper flagship such as the S24. What's weird is that they've chosen to go with an under display front facing camera, which as I'm sure you
can see is not great. Especially we have like lights around very like smeary and halo-y, and for the gaming phone, I get that you don't wanna have like big bezels and whatnot, but it just feels like a strange choice because who doesn't want to use the front facing
camera on their phone? Like I feel that's like
a very normal thing. For context, this is what the front facing camera looks like on the S24 Ultra. Like it is night and day better. Like there's a lot of problems I've got with the REDMAGIC, as I'm sure you're hearing, but the cameras are certainly one of the bigger sacrifices. Look how much better this looks. All of this brings me to my biggest issue with the entire honestly concept of gaming phones in 2024. It's not 2017 anymore, my friends. We have the excellent
dedicated handheld PCs that aren't limited to
just playing mobile games, and Mora. There's the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, the Legion Go. These are all getting
better and more affordable all the time. The idea of your phone being the everything device, it's tempting, like I get it, but at what cost? The REDMAGIC 9S Pro, and really gaming phones in general, they feel like a solution to me that it's a problem that doesn't really exist anymore. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a capable device, but in a world where our normal phones are getting more powerful by the day, are great for gaming,
do so many other things, and if you care about gaming that much, dedicated handhelds are more accessible than ever. It just feels so difficult to justify these compromises. If you really care about mobile gaming, personally, I just think you're better off buying
a more well-rounded flagship that is good at everything, and then buy a clip on cooler, a controller or a battery
bank from time to time. Or well, I don't know. Here's a radical idea. Grab yourself a Nokia 3310, buy a Steam Deck and go out, and live your best life. Because I think it's hilarious. I think the idea of a digital nomad going out into the wilderness with a Nokia 3310 and a Steam Deck, leaving the trappings
of modern society behind sounds like a great idea. Don't see a video next week, that's where I went.  (upbeat instrumental music)"

setup has drastically changed so I used to play Minecraft on this super old office laptop this thing ran games at around 20 FPS but me being so young that was enough to be satisfied now this laptop would soon be destroyed after I decided to download Roblox hacks onto this thing now fast forward to my next birthday my parents got me and my brother a new week you since we shared it I had to use my own money to buy myself a controller and since I was so young I used all my money on the controller the first game I played on the Wii was the Disney infinti me and my brother was really addicted to this game since we were playing up to 8 hours a day now on my next birthday I got a new game for my Wii and I literally played Skylanders every day for a whole year for Christmas and birthday presents I asked for the Skylanders characters and I kept on spending more and more money on more characters now fast forward a few years and fortnite was starting to become really big and sadly I couldn't play fortnite on my Wii and with no laptop as well I played fortnite on my phone I was so invested into fortnite Mobile I decided to buy one of those claw grips for your phone my phone ran 30 FPS at 720p so it was definitely a really really bad playing experience but since I had nothing else to play on mobile was my only option I continue playing mobile every single day and I was seeing myself improving little by little to a point where I even stopped using the claw grips however playing on mobile was really hard because my phone kept on overheating and over time my phone even had battery problems so playing fortnite sometimes would make my phone shut off but after 2 years of playing on mobile my brother finally gave me his PS4 at this time I was playing keyboard and mouse on console and I was using my TV as a monitor eventually I saved up enough to buy a 75 HZ monitor this was a completely new start for me because I was playing on something other than mobile and I definitely saw myself improving really really fast eventually I upgraded my office keyboard and mouse to more a mechanical keyboard and a way better Mouse now with these new upgrades I was getting a lot better because I wasn't limited to a such budget setup and got used to playing on keyboard and mouse really really fast I would say like about 2 weeks after 4 years of saving money I finally got enough to buy myself a gaming laptop and this laptop would be one of the best investments I ever made since I didn't have a laptop stand I was using a book for the stand playing on laptop was definitely a lot better than playing on Console because there was less delay and more FPS and I would continue playing on the same setup for around 6 months I eventually got a new keyboard from a friend and I also decided to try connecting my old monitor to my laptop at this point my setup was definitely still on a really budget side and oh my bro look at the mouse pad how dirty that thing is at this point I was kind of getting money from YouTube so I decided to finally get a new mouse pad it was still a pretty cheap mouse pad but at least it was a larger mouse pad and since I was taking videos more seriously I got myself a pretty budget microphone I think it was around like $30 or so it is honestly a really good microphone still and I had another keyboard since my friend just decided to give me it so shout out to him the upgrades to my setup aren't mainly for improving in fortnite but to help me produce more content since I was taking content seriously and after getting a pretty big viral video I decided to do a bit more upgrades to my setup with the hype of 60% keyboards I decided to get myself an rk61 with brown whiches this thing cost me $50 which wasn't too bad and after a year and a half on laptop I finally got a laptop stand I was definitely improving on fortnite more and more every day and I was definitely seeing myself getting a lot better with the problem of overheating laptop I decided to get a pretty cheap laptop fan from Five Below and also with the rk61 it broke literally a month in so I just decided to get another 60% keyboard and finally I got headphones since I was playing on speakers the entire time for around 2 years and I was definitely liking the new keyboard a lot better than the rk61 just because it was red switches and finally with headphones I finally could hear my opponent compared to when I was playing with speakers and everything was just super super loud with background noises after a few months I decided to get a mouse bunge because my mouse was a Wired Mouse so the wire was a lot dragg on my table and I wanted my setup to be more aesthetically pleasing so I decided to get a big mouse pad that looks amazing that fits my entire desk fast forward a few months I decided to finally upgrade this mouse I had since my console days and I finally got myself a new mouse which was the Viper mini it was definitely a lot lighter than my old mouse and I even got myself a microphone boom arm just so I can make videos a lot easier and for the first time instead of for my setup I decided to decorate my room I put up these wall panels since I saw a lot of people have these and they look amazing and I even put up some shelves on my wall just so I can decorate my room even more this was definitely a huge step for my room since I got even more lights for it and at the time I got my YouTube play button so this was definitely a huge thing for my setup this thing just looks absolutely amazing and after hitting 100,000 subscribers I wanted to do more face videos so I decided to get a webcam for my laptop and this was a complete waste of money cuz I literally never used it at the end this was definitely one of the biggest Transformations for my setup and at the time I thought this was literally the end of my setup this was literally the dream setup about a year later I decided to upgrade with a bunch of stuff a lot which was really unnecessary first thing was these Nano leaves which I wanted more lights in my room I got it in this Zen design it was really really cool at the time but now it literally just fell apart and I don't feel like building it again next I got a new 60% keyboard which was apparently a lot faster than my old budget 60% keyboard the key caps definitely look a lot nicer on this new keyboard and I got myself this red camo mouse pad which I really really like I still use it to this day and the best upgrade during this time was this microphone it helped me a lot for my videos it sounds a lot more professional and I even have it on a different boom arm and then I bought this useless LED thing which I put on my setup for like about a month and now it's literally just in my basement now literally like a week after I got myself a 240 htz monitor for my laptop I connected it to my laptop to run higher refresh rates and also get more FPS it was definitely a really good up upgrade since playing on 240 htz made me a lot better and I improved a lot just from the monitor now finally after 3 years on laptop I finally built my first gaming PC it took around 2 days to build and this thing was absolutely crazy I even got a new mouse which was a super good mouse that I still use to this day and I also got myself a new keyboard which is also really really expensive and with a PC I decid to run dual mod monitor with this 165hz Monitor and at the end this is the setup I Still Rock to this day I don't think I'm going to be upgrading anytime soon make sure to drop a like And subscribe if you guys had a similar setup progression like I did and make sure to let me know down below"

is the newest Mythic brawler coming to the game and he is the first member of a brand new Trio he is a skater that rides a hoverboard all over Star Park and apparently doesn't care much about causing problems he's a big fan of old school hip-hop and plays it very loudly through the boom box he always has with him a young whipper snapper strange part about him is that the music literally hypnotizes anyone that hears it and they have no choice but to dance I stay lit watch me pop this Ollie fam Riding High attack from the sky Ollie's main attack is bring the Ruckus he uses his hoverboard to fire two sound waves that pass through any amount of targets very similar to poco's main attack the two waves are technically separate projectiles and there's actually a tiny space in the middle of them where you can avoid damage at max range but the attacks only deal damage once and the projectiles don't deal separate damage if OE hits them with both it's just the same as getting hit by one very similar to pocos or like Frank's attack Allie super is hypnotized he pumps up the volume on his boom box and dashes forward while his music creates a small area around him that hypnotizes enemies inside the area while hypnotized enemies will not be able to control their own brawler and the brawler will just follow Olli wherever he goes also while the music is playing olly himself is actually muted and cannot attack although he can reload during this time so he's still able to deal some decent burst damage to hypnotize Brawlers as soon as he is not muted now the music plays for about 2 and 1/2 seconds and then it creates a blast that deals damage to to all Targets inside the area even after the blast happens the enemy Brawlers will still be hypnotized for another second or two so keep that in mind alie's first Gadget is regulate when this gadget is activated Alie pops his hoverboard into the air does a kick flip and then hypnotizes enemies that are nearby him when he lands unlike his super this gadget can hypnotize enemies for only 1 second but this gadget does allow OE to hop over walls or water and he can't be hit by attacks while using it alllie Gadget is all eyes on me this gadget is pretty similar to the first since it also hypnotizes enemies for only 1 second but instead of doing a kick flip it just makes all's next attack hypnotize every enemy that it hits this means that Ollie has three different ways to hypnotize enemies oie's first star power is kick push this star power increases alli's movement speed by 20% as long as he is near a wall and when I say near I mean he has to be within one tile of a wall in order for him to get this boost I'm not sure if this is a bug but this star power does not work if OE is next to the edge of the map it has to be a wall within the borders of the map he does keep the speed boost when moving away from the wall but it's only for a split second oli's second star power is Renegade whenever Ollie uses his super this star power will give him a shield with extra Health as soon as he dashes very similar to Gus's super The Shield has 4,000 Health but it decays so fast that even if he isn't hit by anything The Shield's going to be totally gone in about 4 seconds if Ollie is somehow able to recharge his super while The Shield is still there another Shield won't stack on top of the current one and the current Shield will just be replenished back to 4,000 HP now obviously Allie is a support brawler but we're going to put him through the Olympic test and see how well he compares to every single brawler in the game starting with his worst test and working our way up to his best first up we have the boss test OE takes a while to charge his super and even with the help of his super it's not much since it does less damage than his main attack does which is also relatively weak OE defeats the boss in 1 minute and 52.3 seconds and that puts him in 80 seventh place next is the area test neither of all these gadgets are able to break extra skulls and his main attack breaks 16 skulls Alli super can't break any skulls either I really like feel like this has got to be some kind of bug since his super does deal damage but I guess for now ol breaks 16 skulls and only gets 87th Place I think he's going to be better at controlling area than this would suggest next is the Assassin test Al the uses his super very first since the damage is dealt at the very end of the attack and then quickly unloads his first three ammo his reload speed isn't quite fast enough to allow him to fire a fourth shot in time so Allie deals 6,700 damage in 3 seconds and gets 85th Place next we have the three attack kill test each of all these attacks deal 1,700 damage no matter where the attack hits so three attacks equals 5,000 water damage that is enough to take out only eight of the Brawlers in the game and is barely enough to put him in 85th Place next we have the supercharge test all has to land five hits with his main attack in order for him to fully charge one super he also doesn't have the best reload speed so it takes him 5.9 seconds to charge his super which ties him with gray and Ash for 83rd place next is the reload test OE conveniently ties with Buster in this test and it's actually really helpful because of how similar they are so if you have a good feel for how fast Buster can unload and reload his shots you're going to have a really good feel for how OE will attack as well he reloads 10 shots in 23.5 seconds and ties with Buster for 81st Place that is not a very fast reloading super next is the 1 second DPS test OE doesn't unload ammo fast enough to get all three of his shots off within the same second instead he uses his super first and then fires Two Shots right after the blast he deals 5,000 damage in total and gets 81st Place next is the attack range test Ali's main attack reaches 6 and 1/3 tiles and ties with Sandy and Frank for 87th Place which is also kind of nice because those two Brawlers have similar looking attacks to olly so you have a really good feel for how his attacks are going to work for the Box test we already know that OE doesn't deal a lot of damage over time but he can hit multiple targets with the same ammo so the Box test isn't horrible for him since he can normally hit every box per group in the original box test I calculated how many shots it would take for him to complete the test and then just timed how long it would take him to do that once again a reminder this update there were some issues with the developer build so I couldn't actually do the Box test but this is a good estimation he would complete the Box test in 55.4 seconds so he gets 67th Place for the super range test Allie dashes forward five and 1/3 tiles with his super but then the music blast also has a radius that extends it much further unfortunately there's no reticle for the blast so I kind of had to just estimate the radius based on the attack animation and I measured it to be three tiles that is 8 and 1/3 tile which puts Olie in 59th place next is the splash test OE can't hit every box in the splash test at once with his main attack but he can hit over half of them so I calculated how long it would take for him to break open two rows of boxes twice assuming that he picks up a power Cube from the first two rows he also gets a bit of a head start since he can hit every box with his super he completes the splash test in approximately 17.1 seconds and gets 54th Place although there's a decent chance that he could do a little bit faster than that for the Swarm test oi takes out over half of the Bots with one super but because of the shape of the other half he can't take out the rest with a second Super so he uses one of his basic attacks to take out the top row and then finishes the rest with the super he defeats the Swarm in 6.2 seconds and ties with Edgar for 54th place next is the auto aim test even though alli's attack is a fan shape it's actually pretty narrow compared to other fan fan shape attacks in the game and doesn't have the best range either he's barely able to hit Nita from four tiles away and Deals 1,700 damage and gets 53rd Place next is the super damage test the music Blast from Alli super deals 100 damage less with his main attack which is kind of strange but that's 1,600 damage so he ties with guju terara Daryl and Stu for 52nd Place with their damage from their supers uh we have two more tests to show and uh only in those two tests is Alli better than half of the Brawlers in the game granted we don't have a great test to show you know um making enemy Brawlers dance the race test is the first test where Ollie gets a little help from a star power and I mean a little help Ollie has a fast moving speed like some Brawlers like bull or El Primo not very fast but also not normal and he also has quite a few other abilities to help him in this test he starts out by using his Gadget and then waits to use his super until he's past that first wall so that he can get a little value from his star power then gets another quick second of speed boost from the wall after using his super and then finishes the race with a second Gadget he finishes in 9.4 seconds that ties him with Sam Colette and bull for 27th Place but Allie's best test is the survival test in this test he gets Little Help from his second star power but the shield from his super only absorbs two shots so it only adds a couple seconds to a score OE has 11,200 Total Health which is the fourth most in the game so he technically has the most in the game after using his super with his second star power I feel like this also is a good time to mention that OE has a tank trait so he slightly charges his super every time he's dealt damage he survives in 32.1 seconds and gets 26th Place once again support Brawlers don't typically do too well in a lot of these tests a lot of these are based off of damage and you know your ability to like 1 V1 enemy Brawlers and stuff so let's go through each of the game modes and I'm going to talk about how strong I actually think he's going to be because he is a tanky boy and his utility is actually pretty good for Gem grab we're going s tier all these super will be pretty easy to use on an enemy gem carrier and even if he dies while using the super the gem carrier probably is not going to survive long enough as long as all these teammates are paying attention right at least a little bit he also has gadgets that will turn the game around since 1 second of being taunted is usually all you need in a really competitive match to take that brawler out not only is oi going to be great for taking out Brawlers but he's going to be able to use those same abilities to protect his gem carrier from assassins and other close-range Brawlers right s tier for sure I mean think of him as like the perfect counter to like Kenji Edgar or anybody else is going to jump on a gem carrier on you or whatever you just activate that Gadget and boom they can't do anything for bra ball we're going s here as well everything about OE makes me think that braw ball is just going to be his best game mode and specifically one of the best goal scorers in the game he has tons of Health on top of a star power that gives him even more which will make walking the ball just very his super and his second gadget's going to give him completely free Pathway to the goal since he can hold the ball even while he's muted he doesn't have the best DPS in order to defend goals but he can just taunt Brawlers away from the goal which is just as effective right he's going to be really good for brawl ball for heist we're going with the F tier all he just doesn't have the DPS that he needs to be a good heist brawler the only thing that I would even consider is using him to defend Brawlers that dive on his safe but I don't think think that he has the damage to even be a good brawler for that I guess if his other two teammates have like really high DPS then he could be usable on some maps maybe to counter like I don't know maybe a Chuck or something like that I don't think that he's ever going to be there's there's not going to be a good reason to play him in Heist most of the time for Bounty we're going to go with the B tier it's kind of a tough mode to judge for Olli because he probably won't be able to do much in the early game since his range is so short but thanks to the tank trait he will at least be able to charge his super and that might be all he needs to win the match if he can successfully get the enemies killed without dying himself it's also kind of nice that his specialty is taunting Brawlers so that his teammates can kill rather than him killing them so it's not quite as important if he dies because he won't be gaining the Stars his teammates will so we'll go for bti and Bounty and for hotzone we're going to go with the a tier OE may not have the range that he needs to keep enemies out of the Zone but his super will make it just so easy for teammates to regain control of the zone and ultimately the map right that's so important for Hot Zone the only reason I'm not putting him in the S tier for Hot Zone is because he'll probably be feeding the enemies that Su like crazy if he's trying to score points in the zone that being said the sheer amount of Health that he has is going to make it difficult to get him out of the zone so it's tough to say whether or not he'll be broken or balanced so I think the a tier is a safe place to put him for Hot Zone for knockout though we're going to go with the a tier if OE can survive long enough for the smoke to push enemies um in towards the center so that his attack range and Super Range can actually reach them there's a very good chance that he's going to win that round I just don't really see playing him in knockout any other way but that's the only strategy that he needs in order for him to be a really good knockout brawler and that does happen competitively then again if he's able to somehow catch somebody by surprise in the early game with one of his gadgets that's going to also result in a kill a lot of the time I think the a tier makes a lot of sense for knockout for solo Showdown I'm going to go with b or with the F tier maybe D tier H the entire like mechanic of taunting enemies revolves around help from your teammates and if Olie doesn't have any teammates then his super honestly is going to hurt him a lot more of the time than it's going to help him maybe if he Dives on an enemy that can't deal with how much health he has he could still do well but that's pretty risky in Solo Showdown a lot of the sit or a lot of the times right it's just going to be so easy for Olie to be kind of like Frank where he's just going to be picked on by longer range Brawlers and yeah I just don't think that's going to be too good for duo Showdown we'll go with the a tier we're going to be a little bit generous for him alli's obviously going to be way better in Duo Showdown because he's just going to have a teammate that can help deal some damage still I don't think I can give him the S here because while he's going to make it much easier for the teammate to get kills keep in mind he only has one teammate to rely on unlike the two teammates he's going to have in 3v3 modes and using his super still going to be very risky in Duo Showdown and while his teammate will be able to get kills from that distance surviving after taunting enemies is going to be pretty difficult to do so we're just going to go with the a tier still fairly generous honestly I know that he didn't do that great in the these Olympic tests but he seems like a truly broken support brawler on the right maps with the right teammates you know if you can trust your teammates there will be modes where he's going to be pretty useless and if you don't have good teammates like randoms then that's going to suck as well um but I don't know I think competitively he has a lot to offer make sure you stick around for all of alli's voice lines and pins thanks so much for watching make sure you co Caris in the brawl star shop watch me pop this Olli fam jump up jump up and get down nobody going to hold me down nobody going to take my crown who turned off the light don't leave me in the dark I

transformed my setup to where it is now and I'm going to be showing you guys each version of it I'm going to be starting out 4 years ago so at the very beginning of 2020 cuz I kind of didn't film anything the first 2 years so as you guys can see at the beginning of 2020 I'm not even trying to flex or anything this was without YouTube I already had a setup that I was really really blessed to already have I just got my PC I saved up for it for about 2 to 3 years it was in Alienware with 16 GB of RAM a 1660 and and a COR I 7 10th or 9th gen but yeah I had two monitors and of course I was a fortnite kid you can see the fortnite wallpapers the first one is an Alienware 240 HZ 27in Monitor and the one on the left is one from element it's like a random 60 HZ 27 in monitor oh I also did have a second setup cuz I was online school this was the very beginning of the pandemic so I had a laptop I think I had 16 GB of RAM it wasn't a gaming laptop but I also had a Blue Yeti I don't know why I did not use it in my main setup I think I just didn't like the sound quality of it all right now at this this time this was the very beginning of 2021 I had five or 6K Subs I just started doing YouTube and getting some success and this is my setup blinding blue RGB I don't know how my eyes handled that but I had um the Razer Huntsman mini was my keyboard and then I also had the model D minus I think it was I had a huge mouse pad covering the whole desk and both my monitors too I still have those and the same PC I think I said the specs here but um overall it has a core i7 16 GB of RAM and a 16 60 we had some normal decorations over here too so that was pretty good normal chair some paintings but yeah the setup was pretty much the same and my dog at the end I remember making this yep Dog Channel now at this time a lot has changed I just got at the very end of the year of 2021 I was 14 and I got almost 120k subs or something but this was right before I blew up a little bit so I had 70k Subs at this time we had PS5 PS5 was insane for videos back then I had two two PCS we have two big desks and also the shm 7B Apex Pro tkl this keyboard is insane we have the super light the gpro super light I love this mouse bro for 150 it is kind of expensive but it's pretty good we had some RGB lights over there too I have this camera right here I only was started showing my face like 3 months ago at this time I still have this camera it's like honestly a really good camera this one right here before we continue this is dust silver and they sent me two of their super unique keyboards they have a lot of creative designs on all of their keyboards and the packaging on them is also really really nice this pink one that they sent me is their k84 pink blossoms keyboard it's a 75% keyboard and it not only has RGB only on the key caps it also has it all around the keyboard in a bunch of really unique places I really like the way the keyboard looks and the font on it actually matches the keyboard extremely well but the best part definitely has to be the sound there's also a couple of other accessories that come in the keyboard such as a keyc cap puller extra switches and a little bit more like I mentioned dust silver also sent me a second keyboard and this one is actually another 75% keyboard and it's also hot swappable it's called their melon Shake keyboard and the key caps on it look a little bit more like a traditional keyboard compared to the last keyboard and of course it has a ton of nice RGB around it exactly like the previous one and for anyone curious this is how it sounds dust silver also has a ton of different keyboards and just a lot of accessories on their site so make sure to check them out with the first link in the description or pin comment and don't forget to use code Vermax to save 12% on your order thank you so much to dust Sil for sponsoring this video and then you can see kind of stream deck normal kind of things Artic 7 wireless and then we had dual PC which is why we had two different keyboards in mice rk61 this keyboard is about $50 $60 on Amazon right now and then the Logitech g502 so yeah and then same bed oh this was actually a kind of weird spot I had my bed in it was right behind my setup so really it was right over here how it is is right now so it was really really squished I didn't really like it like that we had some random decorations we had the V I made with neon strips Galaxy orb and then oh this was probably the best time I ever had my shelf like organized with decorations look at how stacked this is we had all the Christmas lights this was insane I love this I need to go back to decorating like this bro now at the beginning of 2022 this is honestly probably one of my favorite setups in only 4 months I was able to completely transform my setup I switched to one insane PC that had a 37d 16 GB of RAM and some kind of core i7 I kind of forgot the Gen of it and I also had three monitors we had a 4k monitor a 27 in monitor all of them were 27 in and I still had the 240 HZ and the other two were 60 Herz and there was also a ton of RGB in this setup and you can just see how like much progress I made compared to the other setups they looked more like uh you could say a younger kid was making them but then these ones are when I started kind of taking it a little bit more serious seriously at the very beginning of 2022 I was really trying to like improve as much as I could kind of like make everything match a little bit more we had cables not that messy on the desk we had the same keyboard and mice that I was always using but we also upgraded the mouse pads like to gutsy Aiden and you can just clearly see from the video it just looks so so much better PC case definitely carried the setup a lot too it just really looked nice this one was definitely pretty expensive but all things considered I think the biggest thing that helped my setup was definitely the death during this time I still am using this desk after like 2 years exactly actually and I also did have more ring lights and like more creative positions I had one in the top left and it was overall just more of a clean setup I really really do like the setup and I had a lot of nice RGB and everything on it and back then too I was doing a ton of keyboard and mouse type of fortnite videos cuz I used to only do fortnite type of videos so I had a ton of extra keyboards I kind of used them as decoration I had some extra mice Nintendo switches and just kind of stuff like that and I started using that as decoration and literally this entire setup was only possible from you guys so I definitely have to thank you guys so so much for that and then I did have my two PCS for my old setup Lane on the floor I was kind of thinking if I wanted to use dual PC but if anyone has been wondering I think it's been pretty obvious I sold them cuz they haven't been seen for like 2 years on the channel now going into mid 2022 I might have had arguably a little bit of a downgrade in the setup especially in my opinion I think on the actual setup itself we had a little bit of a Down grade in terms of just how the monitor layout it's a little bit too simple in my opinion I do like simple setups now but this one just didn't really feel that good cuz it would really awkward the monitor positions but the keyboard the mouse pad the mouse pad I'm kind of being a little bit biased maybe because it's my Vermax mouse pad but yeah I love that mouse pad the keyboard and mouse were insane it's just the whole look of the setup didn't look as nice as it used to and I think that's just due to the monitors honestly we upgraded to the key light we had a much better layout than we used to with with the camera and microphone and the PC was actually a huge upgrade it had a 3090 which back then was the best graphics card you could have cuz it was at the very beginning or middle of 2022 I think the 490s were just coming out like right there so yeah that PC was super super expensive literally a huge waste of money cuz everything was so expensive back then I think I ended up spending almost 5 grand I think it was 4.8k for that PC and that's literally cheaper than you can buy a PC right now with a 4090 so everything was just super super expensive back then you can also see that my decorations were definitely getting better and better I'm not going to lie I feel like I kind of lost touch decorating I need to lowkey pick it up again but I love the decorations neon things I had in the setup from GOI goie really carried my setup a lot we had some uh little shelves some boards for hanging up keyboards and backpack I lowkey like that thing a lot I might have to bring that back but yeah now this next video is kind of unique actually I really really did like this setup and it's a 360 video so yeah it's like a fortnite POV video but you can like literally scroll around so this is most realistic you guys can see this wall that you guys are looking at is actually that back wall cuz I used to have my set up facing we have the like camera over there you can see we have the PS5 still I actually just bought another PS5 and then I switched my keyboard to the Apex Pro Mini we had basically the same stuff this time around but yeah I really did like this setup a lot more I just wish my desk was a little bit bigger so I could actually fit the PC that was hiding over here on the side but I love this monitor layout it was insane and also it fit the key light perfect I you'll see I actually switched back to this monit layout in a couple other setups you'll see I switch back to this one cuz I really liked it I also did have a second setup over there on the right it was like my kind of productive setup we had my MacBook kind of schoolwork I didn't really use it as much as I wanted to though I don't know why I look like I have no soul playing that I look like I literally am just dead inside playing that I don't know why I was like lowkey too locked in even for the video at the very beginning of 2023 I kind of wanted to make my setup look like crazy and like insane for YouTube so I tried the quadruple monitor setup and I'm just going to be honest I did not like it it felt way too cluttered didn't even feel like a setup anymore it felt like not cozy at all I did not like it but I did have it's like a really quick cinematic but yeah you can see I had four monitors over there and I mean it was nice the setup it just I prefer three monitors a lot more and you can see I did actually get a new PC this one I actually bought but then later I ended up building it I ended up switching the case on it so this was actually my old one you guys saw in my previous videos the NZXT and I completely rebuilt it into this case so I guess you could say I built the PC but this PC case was insane the height y60 literally my favorite PC case I like it even more than the NZXT H9 or whatever this is called but yeah I didn't really like the setup and you can see there just wasn't any personalization on it there was a good amount of RGB around the room but that was about it I didn't really like the four monitors it's kind of way too Overkill I mentioned the previous setup that I actually loved and I kind of brought it back halfway into 2023 and then I continued it which you guys will see but during summer 2023 LG sent out this insane Monitor and you guys will see it it's a 45 in curved monitor I also did get the biggest upgrade to my setup which is the PC I have right now it has a 490 32 GB of RAM a ryzen 9 550x just insane specs and the PC looks really really good this entire monitor setup might not be for everyone but for me I know I said I don't like Overkill but you can see just how much better this one looked more personalization wise the key light was also really really well placed and the camera which is really important for a YouTuber and everything about this setup was just really really well placed in my opinion not to mention over these videos you can definitely notice just the quality of the videos get better not only with the camera quality but also like kind of cinematics just wanted to point that out because that's kind of what happens you know the more you do YouTube videos and of course I kind of did keep the decoration simple on the setup but they were still really really nice and it was actually at this time where I just finished painting both of my rooms I painted it this kind of you can't really tell on camera but it's like a white white but with a very small hint of gray if anyone was wondering and this is when I just started getting two rooms so I was able to have one room for just like setup and sleep and then the other room is my studio where I kind of build all my setups and actually at the end of 2023 this was the best my room ever looked in my opinion it does not look that good now because I actually ended up switching back to the smaller room cuz I wanted the bigger room for YouTube videos that's another story but this room looked insane with the RGB I actually had three setups in this video so I had one for just my MacBook and my productive setup where I had my Bible I did my Bible study homework all that kind of stuff on that setup and then I had this other one where it was my sim racing setup and that's the one you guys see back there but that's going to go through some changes which you guys will see in a couple future videos I just love the RGB in this room it looked so so good and I also had these nice posters I ended up decorating pretty nicely and I had some car posters and the main setup actually looked really really similar to the previous one I just kind of ended up using this huge monitor for Sim racing instead of actually on my setup cuz the huge monor was really nice some people don't like it but I actually really really did like it but yeah it was just better to use it for Sim racing the only thing that was bad about this setup is you can barely see on the very bottom the cable management wasn't that good this video is pretty different to what I usually make but I've just built so many setups I felt like it's finally time to just go over and kind of wrap it all up cuz this 2024 we're going to have a bunch more of course but yeah if you guys did enjoy this video YouTube recommends any of the two videos up on the screen before I end this video though of course over these last 4 years your guys' support has enabled me to do literally all of this so I thank Jesus for all you guys every single day but yeah like usual if you guys did enjoy this video make sure you click on any the two videos up on the screen right now and yeah that's about it God bless

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW4htOKElYo,Start Enjoying Games Again.,"A while ago I hit a point where I was watching more videos about games than actually playing the games themselves. Whether that was checking in to see where my old favourite title was now or just seeing people talk about some of my all time favourites. If I did jump on a game I would struggle to make it past being on the xbox or playstation home screen, I would just sit and stare at my steam library. Knowing I want to play a game but nothing is calling to me. Some moments I would have a bit of motivation to jump on a particular game such as destiny but I would find myself being bored already of the idea of playing by the time I got to the character menu. So I would close the game, think about how I could have gone from spending hours upon hours playing a game to now struggling to even make it past the loading screens. All of this stems from this idea of feeling as if games just don’t hit the same now as they used to. When we load a new survival world we walk around aimlessly and never make it past an hour of gameplay but when we were younger it was a game we would play all night. All of us have games like this in our lives. The ones we want to love as much as we did but the enjoyment for them and new games just isn’t there. So I wanted to explore this topic, discussing with you about how we can start enjoying games again.

struggling to even get past the loading screens all of this stems from this idea of feeling as if games just don't hit the same now as they used to when we load into a new survival world we walk around aimlessly never making it past the first hour of game playay but when we were younger we could play all night all of us have games like this in our lives the ones that we want to love as much as we did but the enjoyment for them just isn't there and new games just aren't hitting the same so I wanted to explore this topic discussing with you how we can actually start enjoying games again one game that is the epitome of this issue and stands out clear as day to me is Destiny the amount of times that I've loaded up this game to only close it at the character menu is beyond my own comprehension I also know that that it's not just me who has this issue as I've spoken to friends describing the exact same thing and seen countless videos of people talking about the same subject it's a really Bittersweet moment you have a little bit of light casting a massive Shadow making you think that you've become hyped for it but the moment you get 2 minutes into waiting for the game to load and remember what you're in store for you start experiencing that light getting snuffed out for me with a title like Destiny this feeling comes from a place of feeling as if we were played over and over by Bund the gaml was rarely changed and when it was it was such small changes and additions that really weren't that worthwhile over time it was something that I stopped buying into and with that I eventually stopped playing it took me about 2 to 3 years to finally say enough is enough with that game and the last 3 years of DLCs are ones that I've not even bothered to look into this isn't a singular experience either when I've tried to go back and play Black Ops 2 again it just doesn't hit the same and if anything it just feels as if I'm purely playing it in the hopes to reconnect me to the past it makes me feel nothing more than as if I'm trying too hard to enjoy something like I was 11 once again not only that though when I go and play a game like Minecraft I'll create a world have high hopes for what I want to do but I have zero clue exactly where I want to start and what I want to be doing mid to late game I'll start working on something and then get bored within maybe a maximum of 3 weeks I'll then decide to close down the world however most of the time I struggle to even make it past the point of my first base I'll spend all my time Mining and then get to the surface richer than ever but with nothing to do and the last game that truly had this impact for me was GTA 5 more particularly GTA roleplay as I found myself coming to Pure exhaustion I was playing a game to such an extent that it was becoming boring because I was so accustomed to it so much of the game relies on other players and the interactions from them to make it enjoyable that a lot of the time you're just waiting around waiting for the true elements of the game play to come come through and it would take so much out of me by the end of my experience with it that I had to step away and stop playing these types of games in particular Not only was I struggling to get into certain titles and certain game franchises I'd find myself watching YouTube very regularly but only watching content about games and then never playing them myself during 2020 through to 2021 I found myself rarely playing many games and mainly watching a load of content about them the reason for this was just time availability time is such a big deal when it comes to everything we do in life and if I have the option to just watch a 1H hour long video talking about a game that is 50 hours plus of gaml then honestly I'll probably end up doing it as it saves me a lot of time and it makes it a less daunting task to have to take on than you know playing that 50h hour title it's happened to me with many games which means that I have a lot of knowledge about many games and even full franchises that I have no interest in actually playing for myself and to be honest I probably won't even end up playing first to understand understand this though I want to talk about why exactly this is happening so let's talk about the three main reasons that have affected me personally in many periods of my life and hopefully they can resonate with you in some way and get an understanding in your own mind as to why this feeling occurs the first reason that is the most outspoken in gaming is just that games just aren't hitting the same anymore they're not being made in the same way in comparison to what they used to be this is the easy scapegoat many of us will use when talking about how we don't enjoy gaming anymore whether that's how new games don't optimize their titles for the regular player meaning tryhards opinions are valued above all else or how games are just simply not in a good spot when it comes to releases this reason is one that I wanted to get out of the way as I've said within that as it's an easy scape which means that it's easy to Target but it doesn't really help us get anywhere are we correct in our belief that gaming is worse in terms of out it's being made today yes maybe in some areas we are but it's not really solving the actual issue of why we're not enjoying games again is it solving the problem probably not it's not solving the problem for us so we have to dive a little deeper into understanding some reasoning I'm saying this as well because I do dislike things like the corporate greed side of gaming scummy microtransactions The Unfinished titles and just the toxic communities built around many releases however knowing all of this is great and all but it doesn't actually help us in any way to solve the problem that we're wanting to solve or at least it doesn't on a surface level an idea from self-improvement that I've Loved for a very long time is that we might not know what we want to do or who we want to be but we have that anti-hero in our head the version that we don't want to really become and the version that we can avoid at all costs ideally it's those tropes that you don't want to take in from your parents or those things that you see in other people that you don't want to take in as your own ways of being and it means that you can effectively create this idea in your head of the stereotypical worst side of gaming and what you can avoid instead when understanding why we feel this way we need to accept that things are the way that they are right now and there's only a small amount of stuff that we can do as of right now to even change this or impact the way that the market is going and to go back to that scapegoat point the reason I want to say that this is a scapegoat is that a lot of the time we can use this to mask over the true reason we aren't enjoying games anymore which has nothing to do with new releases because if it was as simple as all of these new games were bad then why are people enjoying many of the titles that release why aren't we just going back to Old titles and loving the experience massively you might want to say these people just don't have good tastes and that's why they can't have an opinion on this topic which I've spoken about elitism in gaming in Prior videos and that's kind of where I feel like a lot of people end up falling into this line of thinking cuz the moment you kind of throw a CounterPoint in there they kind of just throw this idea of that you just have a bad taste in games which brings me to why I've been calling this escapegoat and one of the most impactful reasons for why we stop enjoying many things in our lives whether it's a other hobby that we enjoy we might love reading a book and then out of nowhere we just don't enjoy reading it right now we just don't enjoy reading as a whole we might love doing rock climbing or gaming for example and you know what we end up feeling as if we no longer enjoy it and the main reason for this is our mental health this is something that you rarely hear spoken about within the Gaming Community as realistically who wants to talk about it we just want to jump on a game and be happy with it and because it's such a subjective thing that it can be very easy to just kind of go nope I have no issues therefore this isn't the answer it's also a subject that's very in and out of the gaming culture the reason I believe that this is one of the bigger issues around this topic is that it's really easy to just say gaming isn't fun anymore but actually asking why is really important there's a concept called the five wise as you might be able to tell it means that you need to ask five yse so if you believe something like gaming isn't enjoyable anymore then ask yourself why well it's because companies just make bad games nowadays because gaming is nothing more than woke now because capitalism sucks or maybe it's because my mental health just isn't in the right space right now and therefore I'm just saying that the whole community and the whole area of gaming sucks right now instead of cracking down on the real reason why it's happening which has more to do with life itself than the actual culture within the gaming landscape now yes that one sounds really specific but that just gives you an idea into what I'm trying to say to you you might genuinely think that gaming sucks now but you still find enjoyment from some releases that come out from time to time which is fine however for those who are just struggling to enjoy gaming as a whole I wouldn't be surprised if this has more to do with your life outside of gaming than it does an actual you know idea of gaming as a whole I think that it has more to do with the outside world and because that thing that we used to use as a comfort blanket just isn't cutting it anymore it's easier just to say that gaming as a whole just isn't where it should be than it is to actually you know dive deep into the reason behind it the last part is linked to two concepts I briefly mentioned over the last couple of minutes one has to do with what comes with age which is responsibilities and the other is productivity getting older has obviously brought around plenty more responsibilities or at least it has for me right now I wouldn't be surprised once I've hit 40 I'm still going to have a load of responsibilities but ideally a lot of my life will kind of be in check enough that I can just enjoy things as I see fit and you know find time to enjoy games enough right now though it is just hard to find time for games and actually enjoy them in a way that isn't just making me think constantly about the right now responsibilities that I need to be taking on I mentioned earlier about how I used to love watching content way more about games than actually playing them myself which comes from this issue when you don't have enough time to really sit down and enjoy a game you're going to be subjected to two options in front of you either watching content about games or playing games that you know are time syncs but way smaller entities of it for the likes of cod you may decide that you only have half an hour to play so you're going to jump on and play 3 to six matches of Call of Duty or you can spend that half an hour watching a video essay like this about how you know you just aren't enjoying games anymore and the second one being productivity is a little bit of a hindrance when it comes to our enjoyment of playing plenty of games out there I'm someone with an incredibly perfectionistic way of viewing my life which has made me incredibly aware of the way that my brain is wired so I end up questioning everything that my brain is doing just to make sure that I'm doing it for the right reasons but when I'm playing a game My Mind always knows that I could be doing something else but really most of us wouldn't be doing anything else with that time which wasn't just another thing that we're just completely wasting our time with the meta productivity hack is realizing that you need downtime to truly be productive so the next time that your brain may think to you well we could be doing something else right now just remember that you do actually need downtime to fully prepare yourself and prepare your mind for the productive task that you need to be doing later on these are the big wise gaming just isn't treated the right way by the companies that we used to love our mental health sucks Our Lives just aren't where we want them to be we're focusing on being as productive as possible and having as productive of a mindset as we can and simply having way more responsibilities in our life so let's actually talk about dealing with these issues headon in a way that I actually believe is most fitting in terms of solving the issue so this will be in a particular order and I'm going to mention at the end some actionable steps that you can take from the video as I don't want this to be a video that you just kind of forget about don't watch again I want you to actually write down some stuff you know write down on a piece of paper okay I need to do this or I want to do this to try out and see if this works for me I'm going to go through some of the things that have worked for me when it comes to enjoying games once again the first step is one that you're already doing most likely or you might want to consider doing if you haven't done it just yet which is to take a break stop playing some games for a few months disconnect from this world do some other bits in your life just for the moment that doesn't mean you can't check in on some of the areas that you like watch some of your favorite content creators however one of the best things that you can do is just disconnect from this entire area just for a little bit a lot of people's Joy within something does come from the novelty of the thing itself many of us grew up playing games and with that played so many for hours on end that over the course of Our Lives probably will make us question what we could have been doing with even 10% of that time if we had it available not saying the games are bad in themselves I'm just stating this because obviously as a distraction mechanism gaming is entirely designed to be that and because of this it means that it's very good at its job and it means that it can distract us for longer than we may want to when I took my first ever break from playing games this was back in 2019 it lasted roughly 4 months during this time I was really depressed I was struggling a lot with Direction in my life and I had just left left College because the environment itself just sucked that I was being a part of but also I found myself just enjoying other things in life outside of this I won't get into those sorts of things on this channel I might talk about on my personal channel so yeah a little quick you know shout out to that channel go check it out it'll be linked down below during this time I didn't really feel as if I had the desire to play a game or as if I needed to be playing games the only reason why I got back into playing in the first place was because I wanted to jump onto a Minecraft World with a few of my friends besides that I didn't really feel this desire to have to be online all the time and be gaming at every waking minute that I had available that wasn't dedicated to work I went on to have a couple other breaks as well from playing games one on purpose and the other coming from this constant feeling of whenever I would load up a game I just didn't care about playing it games like Destiny come to mind as I've already mentioned the final break that I had then brought me back into playing games a lot more but in a way more healthier manner than I was previously and this was the version of myself in 2021 I hadn't really been playing much for the first half of the year and at that time I also met my girlfriend and I also knew that I wanted to be making videos as I had been for you know on and off for like 11 years this led to me playing The Last of Us because I really wanted to jump onto something that was story driven again and afterwards I then played Skyrim again and Assassin's Creed 2 and those games allow me to just enjoy the experience that I knew I loved but also allow me to get into the hobby again without the toxic side of it coming out toxic games are pretty easy to find in your life many can categorize the mass majority of multiplayer games as these sorts of toxic games for me that definitely is true however generally the best way of knowing if a game is toxic is based on these three criteria the first is if you get angered or overly frustrated when you play a specific game games like csgo or souls for me are the ones that come to mind with this particular issue the second is similar to when you meet up with that one friend or that person in your life who just drains every ounce of your existence from you and you're just left wanting to do nothing more than just go home and sleep for a bit because you feel as if you've had everything taken away from you with like an hour of speaking to them and the same is true when it comes to games Destiny is the game that always did that for me I never felt good about myself after playing I just felt emotionally drained and like I was a husk of the person that I was just a few hours prior now yes that might be a tad dramatic but it's the best way of describing those feelings the last one is quite similar to the second but differs slightly instead of focusing on if a game is emot draining we're going to focus on if you're lying to yourself about actually enjoying the game which means the final criteria is understanding whether or not the game that you are playing is actually one that brings you any form of Joy or happiness or if you're simply just addicted to the feeling that the game gives you sometimes these are the games you might find as mostly really mediocre experiences but like gambling you can constantly keep pulling that lever until you eventually get a win battle Royals are a very good example of this that come to mind or really any online FPS tactical shooter another way of judging this as well is if you think that you're playing a game that you actually enjoy just ask yourself the question about how often you're smiling when you play the game Destiny comes to mind for me it's a game that for years I believed I enjoyed and loved which probably stems from this place of truth but the harsh reality of it is that it's more similar to a love for something than an actual enjoyment of something something you love is very similar to something you hate it's just that one bad day can lead you to going towards that thing that you absolutely despise when I realized that I was just sitting there looking at a screen for 6 hours on end rarely cracking a smile let alone laughing with my friends I realized this game was one that I needed to step away from this doesn't mean you have to drop every single multiplayer game that you're ever playing or stop playing challenging games what you need to do is figure out whether or not a game is providing value to you or your life or if you're simply being played by the game like Tik Tok or short form content or YouTube videos like this you'll forget about the next match the next day but you know what you feel as if you kind of need to keep playing the next one is going to be really hard for many of us out there but is essential for me personally which is to stop consuming negative gaming content the reason I'm saying it's hard is because it's everywhere I upload negative videos from time to time but you'll know what I actually try to make some form of you know valid arguments and and also I try to give a positive spin on what I'm talking about but you'll know exactly the type of content creator that I'm on about when I explain it those content creators are you know the people who are mainly posting content that seems a bit too much like pure rage bait most of the time or they're just trying to keep you up to date about the new thing that you're meant to be annoyed about or enraged about there are many creators out there and I'm not prepared to go to war with all of the big ones in the space but I think it's a crucial thing to do if you want to start enjoying games similar to how if you're already annoyed when you jump onto a game you're probably going to end up more annoyed than you were previously or at the very least you're just not going to have a very fun experience because you're not in the right State of Mind before playing we need to start disconnecting ourselves from this content and if you're still wanting to be in the know about something like this and just jump on from time to time to be up to date just watch a weekly skillup video he'll round up everything within a half an hour sitting to maybe an hour from time to time guess what it's half an hour to an hour once a week that is far better for you when it comes to dealing with content especially considering he doesn't like you know talk about how oh this this specific thing is happening and this specific thing is happening are tomorrow I'll tell you all about how this company is awful and this it's like just watch one video a week it summarizes everything and it's not absolute rage bait for views like there is within some in the industry and another similarity that this has to other areas of life for example is if you already feel in a sad state of mind or you know what you're in a neutral you don't have a particularly like over the top you're excited you're happy and you're not that much of you know someone who's just down you don't feel that bad but then you start listening to music now music plays a massive role in the way that we can feel if you're consuming nothing more than negative music all the time your mood will naturally lower because of it it's something that I'm working on myself when it comes to that when it comes to music but it's also the same within gaming if you're just always consuming negativity negativity negativity all that's going to happen is make your day worse because you're allowing outside influences to take over the way that you feel on a day-to-day basis because you know what you decided you're going to sit and you know see someone talk [ __ ] about how Activision are awful for like 10 minutes and then you're going to watch their next video where they talk about how Bungie's awful for the next 10 minutes and guess what sometimes those things are granted but a lot of the time people are just rage baiting you over stuff that fundamentally you don't care about you don't care about it and they had to spend about 20 minutes explaining to you about why you should care about it after we've gotten rid of the negative games and the toxic content creators I would highly recommend just creating a short list of some games that you're interested in playing and the ones that you would like to play but you've just never gotten round to it and this shouldn't be an over-the-top list I'm not one to create an Excel sheet that has my entire backlog of games that I need to play as I personally just find it massively overwhelming and I think it's an over-the-top way of seeing all the games that you might want to play as you'll put anything and everything on that list create a list maybe around 10 different games that you've wanted to play for quite a while now you might already own them like 90% of all the games that haven't been touched in people's steam libraries or it might be a game that you haven't gotten around to picking up just yet for me this would include the likes of ghost of sushima The Last of Us Part Two breath of the wild Miles Morales Spider-Man 2 Mana Lords and a few more these are a few games that I'm interested in playing and I haven't before hence why I've started very recently playing ghost of tsushima by creating a small list it will give you a far more achievable look to the games that you actually want to check out the new releases or old games that you want to actually play for the first time I believe creating a list of games that you find interesting is the best thing that you can do as it will make you realize that you haven't actually opened your horizons up enough when it comes to the games that you want to play and it allows you to realize that the conclusion that you've got which is games aren't fun anymore kind of isn't backed by the evidence that you've got right in front of you the evidence in front of you might show a gaming Market that you're not happy with which is fine and I completely get that but what this does at the very least is make you question why you are actually believing that games just aren't fun anymore and it might actually make you have to dive into those aspects that I mentioned earlier in the video another thing to take into account when you're trying to pursue enjoying games again is you need to remove this feeling of needing to do something or the need to jump on I'm going to contradict myself in a moment but you'll understand why the reason I'm saying that you don't need to force yourself to play is because sometimes you just aren't in the right State of Mind you actually have other things that you need to be getting on with or it's the case that you're just making playing a game far more work than actually something you're doing for leisure the contradiction though does come from when you play those titles that you want to get into but after a few hours you just seem to fall off and never touch again and you end up repeating the same cycle where you may end up playing the introduction into a game multiple times we need to learn how to strike the balance perfectly between not forcing ourselves to just jump on because of an amounting pressure internally of we need to play the game that we can't stop playing cuz otherwise we're going to get lost and not end up playing it at all because you know sometimes like I said earlier we have things in the real world that we have to do but also knowing when we need to give ourselves that little bit of a nudge so that the game that we've just started playing but we've taken a week off of playing doesn't get lost in the dust and somewhere forgotten as an experience and now you have to go back to the beginning the next time you decide to jump on one side of need is bad it creates this over-the-top Doom feeling whereas the other one just allows you to continue experiencing the thing you're playing so many of us have this experience that we start to get into a game you know what you actually kind of really like it and then boom another big release comes out of nowhere around the corner that you just forgot about what you knew was there but you just thought you know what I'll play this game and I'll continue afterwards and then you just kind of get wrapped up in that new release and you just stop playing the previous one sometimes we do have to force ourselves to enjoy something it might sound contradictory but it's something that we all know to be true at times especially considering one of the biggest examples of this is something like working out if you don't feel the need to go to the gym one of the best things you can do is simply forcing yourself to go but also another way of doing it that it doesn't feel as much like you're forcing yourself is just to ask yourself the question of how will you in 5 hours feel or how will you tomorrow feel if you don't go to the gym or you do go to the gym today most likely you will probably feel great about yourself if you haven't gone and done it the same goes in many other areas of life it's why for as much as I do believe to a high extent that it's the game's responsibility to keep us entertained and interested in the game I'm not against forcing myself to play through a specific point of a game if the title is beloved by others as there's got to be a reason there that people love the games so much a big example exle for this and I've mentioned this in many videos before was Red Dead 2 I forced myself through the first 10 hours of the game cuz I was like so many people love this game I don't like cowboy stuff I also just thought the game was really slow to begin with and guess what I forced myself through 10 hours of it I got to know the characters that were there and I ended up falling in love with the game and finding it as one of the best gaming experiences that I've ever had this goes for many other titles out there sometimes you do need to put pressure on yourself to play the game and just get through a certain point that you take in and soak up the knowledge but at other times you do end up feeling as if you just need to jump on the game because you said to yourself that you would at least put an hour every single day into playing instead allow yourself to just kind of do it in es and flows and if you notice that you're falling off a game question to yourself is this a game that you actually want to play or do you want to replace it with a game that you're more interested with sometimes though we don't actually need to force ourselves to jump on a game and also we don't need to stop ourselves from forcing ourselves to jump on a game because we may feel guilt for not doing something sometimes we end up inspired to jump on a game and we end up really enjoying it this isn't something that I ever really thought about until very recently I found myself realizing that there's loads of games that I've played that have come based off of inspiration from other sources as I've mentioned in a few different occasions now ghost of tsushima is a game that I'm playing for the first time not really as it's technically my third attempt of playing it the first two were over a year ago or so now roughly as I was originally going to look at making a video about the game at that point of time so I forced myself to play and I just wasn't enjoying the experience at that point I would only make it through the first couple of hours before then closing the game and just giving up on the process however a few weeks ago I watched Shogun which made me really immersed into the world of feudal Japan the one thing going through my mind when I made it about halfway through the show was that when I am home I'm going to play Ghost of tsushima which I ended up doing doing when I see a cool building or medieval styles of housing around the UK it always makes me feel as if I want to load up a Minecraft world and see if I can build it for myself when I watched through Game of Thrones on multiple occasions which yes that means that I am admitting to you right now here on the internet that I've watched Game of Thrones multiple times I'm not going to State how many times because people will question me uh but yeah let's just say I've watched it quite a few occasions over the last like 6 years so obviously sometimes that was watching seasons 1 to 5 over and over again until the season 6 came out and what not cuz I found the world incredibly immersive but what it made me do is really want to jump on Skyrim or The Witcher 3 even Assassin's Creed Valhalla a game that I talk a lot about and not in a positive manner by any means ends up coming to mind as something that I actually want to jump on and want to give a second chance because of something like the Vinland Saga what this means is that we don't necessarily always need to force ourselves to play a game an actual better approach that I've found generally that brings way more joy to playing the games that I actually want to play and way more joy to the gaming hobby as a whole is finding outside resources to help ease me in we should be aiming to get inspired to play a game inspiration will do wonders for wanting to play through something in comparison to pressure or motivation which is a really weird word to use when talking about playing a game I mentioned it earlier about playing Destiny it feels weird to say as I don't really feel like you can be motivated to play a game I guess you can at times but it just kind of feels odd I don't know if it's more just hype or motivation who knows if they're basically the same thing or if they're interchangeable in any way who knows all I know is that it just feels weird to say motivation I do think though inspiration is genuinely there and can actually help you get into a game way more if you have zero clue which game you're actually interested in jumping on right away or maybe you do have a clue of some of the ones that you're interested in instead of jumping on straight away spend a little bit of that time on that break that I mentioned from gaming just go outside see things visit some countries get immersed into other cultures watch shows that will immerse you into those new time settings or different worlds for you to explore all of this will add to the idea of becoming inspired to play a game the final way to really start enjoying a game again that I've hinted at throughout this video but haven't said directly to you is to start having a life there's one big reason for this which is that many of us who game only have this hobby as a hobby we might have some smaller interests here and there but they haven't really reached that status of actually being a hobby we also don't really have a proper life we just work sleep game and then maybe make some time for a friend or family member every few weeks this is why you're not enjoying games anymore you've not allowed yourself to actually enjoy life itself and you're only playing a very specific subset of games the main thing that I would highly recommend that some will find sounds incredibly silly but does need to be said because some do need to hear this which is the guy outside touch grass is a saying in the gaming world because so many of us are not only chronically Gamers uh we're also chronically online which means that we haven't spent enough time doing real life things the less time you spend in the digital world I guarantee your general life will get better obviously that is a blanket statement some games are genuinely the best bits of entertainment and storytelling that have ever been made by people some creators genuinely make thoughtful content but this isn't the content I'm talking about I'm talking to the people who play competitive Shooters watch live streams for hours a day watch YouTube drama content and rage bait you need to strip this toxic side of the internet out of your life and replace it with far more positive real life experiences besides going outside you need to build friendships and actually you know dedicate time towards your family again you might be someone who doesn't have the best family life but for those who kind of have a decent family life or you have some people who you know you're still connected with but others you're not try and actually spend time with them it will be far more of a worthwhile thing to do while you can then be playing games every single waking minute especially in the gaming space where so many of our friends aren't really friends some are for sure but others are much more just like gaming buddies you don't do anything in real life with them similar to how many don't actually have real proper friends they just have Drinking Buddies for adults it's increasingly difficult to make friends let alone make friends of people you actually want to be friends with so start doing more get into new hobbies join some Club reach out to people on the likes of Instagram even if you don't meet up with them you can jump on a zoom call and just have a chat I found myself actually making friends of people who I genuinely want to talk to and catch up with quite regularly just through that last thing alone I would also highly recommend getting into some new hobbies as like I said for many this is their only one that they've got so try out some things that You' found interesting in the past no matter what it is try to get rid of that built-in stigma towards doing something and just try it out and see if you like it create a list like the one I mentioned earlier of creating a list for games you're interested in to just some new hobbies that you might be interested in checking out reading is a great place to start for many out there if you want to do something that's just from home and doesn't take you too far out of your comfort zone getting into something like a sport as well that you might have done when you were younger or just trying out some form of creative Pursuit having more Hobbies than just gaming will make gaming even more enjoyable as you'll be able to go into it when you truly find something you enjoy instead of going into it because you feel as if you don't have much else to do having a life is is probably the best Roi thing you can do to start enjoying games again in my opinion my goal with this video was to try and help you guys out and actually get you to enjoy games again however I don't want you just to forget about this video and you know the next couple days you just stop caring about it you know don't even think about this subject again grab a notebook for a second ideally a physical one if you need to use something like Apple notes or whatever and here is a few actionable steps that might be worthwhile trying to do or pursuing obviously malleable try out whatever whatever you want to do see what works for you and what doesn't the first is to take 60 days off of playing games if you haven't already get a gym membership and go twice a week at minimum create a list of 10 games that you're interested in checking out create a list of 5 to 10 Hobbies you're interested in and then actually make plans to go and try them out check out two to three new shows or movies that you haven't watched before which again will hopefully get you inspired in some way to play a game in the future invite two to three friends on a walk or shared activity together start watching YouTube with more intention and getting rid of all the rage bait content you might be consuming lastly uninstall all of the negative games from your PC and console those eight things will allow you to start enjoying games again even if some of them don't feel as if they're related to gaming in any way like the gym side of things I promise you that if you start enjoying your life far more you will become happier with yourself and with life itself that every single aspect of your life including gaming will just get better so please try out these things get back to me on how they go for you and the progress that you've made with yourself and you know what the games that you want to enjoy and check out also let me know down below what's worked for you if I haven't mentioned it in this video I'd love to know anything extra and what can be done to help others or help me in the future if I go through the exact same things again where I need to kind of you know take a step back and actually dial in my thoughts if you did enjoy today's video make sure to leave a like and make sure to hit that subscribe button I've also got a monthly game club that I host in the Discord so make sure to come on by if you're interested this month is Ghost of sushim which works for me as I recently started playing it as again I've mentioned I feel like I keep mentioning this I'm sorry if I am reiterating myself a bit too often in these videos lastly if you do want to support the channel it would be greatly appreciated check out the patreon down below it's as low as I believe $1 a month I believe I would need to double check that uh but yeah the actual tier that gets you early access to things and just gets you a little bit of extra stuff is the XR ones which is $5 a month so make sure to check that out if you are interested any support is much appreciated as this channel yeah it's the case that I would like to you know enjoy doing more of it and be able to dedicate a bit more time and resources to making the content better for you with that being said I'll see you guys in the next one have a good one [Music]

here is the Amazon PC and it actually cost me $430 so it was a little bit less than my budget was okay let's throw this massive box down we have like some random papers packaging and here is the actual PC itself all right so on camera I hope you guys can tell but the PC case itself is actually pretty big it's not like one of those really tiny ones that I usually get at this price point some people find it annoying that they add like this packaging inside but honestly I kind of do like it just to protect the GPU a little bit and make sure like nothing was damaged so that's a plus okay so let's just peel that off dude look how much cleaner it looks without it holy okay let's peel this off too and my immediate First Impressions is the cable management is actually pretty good I do really like how they kind of overall went for mainly a black theme there's not really anything that's like ugly cuz I've had some like teu piecs that have been black with like really bad red accents one thing I don't like that much though is that the cables inside are not completely all black like the CPU fan cooler at least it's not a stock cooler so that kind of is a plus I don't think it's RGB but you can see there's like a little bit of green blue going on over here and under the graphics card you really won't see that so yeah overall though I actually do really like the way they cable Managed IT there's even like zip ties they added over here so already that is doing better than I expected if you're looking to upgrade your setup make sure to check out gigabyte brand new monitor called the M27 Q Advanced ice it's not just the normal gaming monitor it's a 27in IPS panel that's 180 HZ and 1 millisecond response time only and the best part about it is it's QHD which means you have a resolution of 2560 by 1440 which makes a huge difference so not only are you getting amazing colors on the monitor panel with the IPS panel like comes with but you also get really good quality because it's 1440p resolution you get all of this without sacrificing any performance because it's still a80 HZ monitor the monitor itself feels really good and I love the way it looks because the bezels on it aren't really that big at all the monitor stand itself is just not bulky at all and the thing I love about it is it doesn't take an entire huge amount of space because now you have more Mouse space so if you're playing competitively in fps shooter games it helps out a lot the monitor also has an ergonomic viewing design which I find really helpful when you're playing competitive games like fortnite valerant csgo or any kind of shooter games like that you also get a bunch of pretty cool features such as flicker-free low blue light to protect your eyes a black equalizer to deepen the details of like the dark areas of the Monitor and so much more so if you're interested make sure to click the first link in the description and pin comment I'm also going to be hosting a giveaway for this monitor on my Twitter or X so make sure to go down below and also follow me on that for details for it and again thank you gigabyte for sponsoring this video and of course I can only explain the way the PC feels like you guys can actually physically be here and like feel it but like actually like build quality Wise It's kind of what I would expect it doesn't feel super cheap but it also doesn't feel like extremely expensive like a $1,000 gaming PC or something like that okay like always let's take a look at the back cuz they can make the front of the PC look good where you actually see it but I just want to see what they actually did with the back of the PC case cuz the average person won't see this so I'm just curious if they actually did some cable management back here I'm going to be the first to admit whenever I build PCS I I don't do cable management but I'm just curious if they do okay yeah so this is way way better and I do honestly these are like the hard drive cases but I don't need them I'll just take it out I don't know I just think they kind of look ugly I don't need those but yeah the cable management looks really good you you see they have zip ties all over this thing all over the Fan Hub cables even all these cables from the PC case also even the ones coming from this from the power supply they even cable managed it a little bit more so honestly this PC case like and the way this company actually handled it was actually really nice okay the only other things that were in the box was of course the PC power supply and like the RGB like controller you can switch with and it also does give you a Wi-Fi dongle cuz there's not Wi-Fi built into this motherboard and I was going to also point out the motherboard on this PC is like it's not a fullsize motherboard I can't tell whether it's a micro or like I'm not that good with the sizes of the motherboards but it's definitely not a full sizee so it kind of does make the PC look like not that filled out with the space cuz there's a lot of empty space here I mean dude there's like literally half the case isn't being used up you don't even need a PC case this big for what they did but I mean let's see how it actually looks when I turn it on okay so it has six fans in this PC case and yeah the CPU Cooler is not RGB but that's kind of to be expected I'm not going to lie me personally fourth like this but yeah you do have one fan over here in the back you also have two up top and then I'll kind of flip the PC like this you also have three up on the front here so you do have enough cooling for the kind of performance this PC is putting out not including performance I think aesthetically for $400 this is definitely one of the better looking PCS you can get cuz it actually does look half decent I actually do kind of like it of course the main part about a gaming PC though is the actual specs cuz that actually is what matters the most so this is actually the first time I've had a Pentium processor it's called the g4500 and it is supposedly supposed to be the same performance as a core I 56 gen so we'll see how that is and it also has 16 GB of RAM which I'm 90% sure is ddr4 but we're going to have to check that one thing I just did notice actually is it's only one stick of ram so that means it's just one 16 GB stick instead of two 8 GB so you don't have a dual Channel Ram but you also do have an RX 580 for the GPU so it's not an insane GPU it's not also the worst one but it definitely is more of a budget one I do think for this price point you could probably find some better priced PCS with like a little bit more performance but you also have to take into consideration like how the PC looks and all that but let's actually compare it to how the timu PC is I don't know why teu stopped doing their kind of nice orange packaging that they used to do when I used to order from timu but hey this is the teu box and you can probably already tell that this box is actually bigger than the Amazon one so I think there is more stuff in here okay and I think they did the exact same thing yeah there's another box inside of here so they both did do pretty good packaging okay so one thing you do have to keep in mind at the time of recording this video the Teemu PC is actually an extra $50 I did see on the product images it came with like a bunch of other random things such as like a speaker keyboard and mice that should be in here all right so here is all the perer so it definitely did come with a lot more than the other PC oh and there's also the mouse hiding under here too all right and here is the teu PC so you can obviously tell it is white and it is kind of a smaller PC case but I obviously can't really see that much of a look inside but it looks like it's more filled out all right so of course we have to take off this wrapping like usual okay it also looks like here is like some extra cords and of course like the like RGB controller and it also had like the Wi-Fi and Google dongle and not Google dongle uh Bluetooth all right for any of you guys that are curious this side panel actually is glass the other one was also glass but sometimes they cheap out when we get like plastic ones so at least this one's actually glass they also do have this packaging inside just to kind of make sure nothing gets misplaced and yeah honestly I'm just going to be honest I think I do like the way that the Amazon PC looks and it wasn't like $50 less too obviously looks aren't everything but I do personally think that these kind of crystall looking RGB like fans just like look really cheesy that's just my opinion I do think at night when you actually won't be able to notice it and there's like white it's a white PC and there's like all this nice RGB I think it will look nicer but yeah you can see it has like the same sized graphics card but it fills out the PC case way more and actually like looks more proportionate it just is cuz the PC case is smaller the other one was pretty big another plus to this PC is they actually did have all black cables that also people really shouldn't care that much but the CPU Cooler is RGB so it it will make it look better but I overall think the aesthetic of the other PC was still better they did do a little bit of cable management cuz there's just like one zip tie but I don't really know if you'd consider that too much cable management but let's take a look at the back here all right so over here on the back I think the other one was definitely like obviously cable manage better but this is not like bad they do have a couple zip ties here and I think they're actually using the same Hub controller I'm not 100% sure but I think it's the same Fan Hub but yeah overall I will say this PC kind of seems just like lower quality I guess you could say it is kind of up to the brand it's not so much of the website that's selling at like Amazon or teu but this specific one I bought at least I think the way it feels and some of the way it looks like it just feels kind of Cheaper even though it was more expensive but I'm about to show you guys why it was more expensive okay so let's just turn it on real quick to just see how it looks um there should be RGB I mean here let me turn on the RGB controller imagine the RGB doesn't work that's kind of weird that it doesn't automatically turn on cuz all the fans are spinning okay there we go so yeah you just have to use a remote but honestly I do think the other PC was just had a more expensive Vibe cuz you can see the RGB not this CPU fan cooler but if you can actually see on the like fans themselves like the individual fans you can see the RGB is coming like more from the center on camera it kind of looks more normal but in person I think it did look better when it just came from like the outline of the actual like fan and I also did notice that the casing like the little Crystal casing on these is actually different from these white ones I think these normal white ones down here look a lot better but I don't know if you guys have seen but this GPU and there's also two RAM sticks the specs on this PC if you guys didn't guess are better so for starters for the processor we have a core I 74770 in here so I'm not 100% sure if it's better but I think it's probably going to be similar it does have 16 GB of RAM as well which is probably ddr4 but the thing is that it is two so that is better with this PC and definitely the main advantage this PC has over the Amazon PC is the actual graphics card it's a 1660 TI which I haven't test both haven't tested both of them side by side exactly but I just know for a fact that this one's going to have way better performance so that's just me saying that but let's just see how much better the performance on this PC is cuz I do think aesthetically the P other PC I would way rather have to be honest this one just kind of feels a little bit cheaper but you also do have to remember it came with a bunch of different peripherals now if it were me I definitely wouldn't Factor all these peripherals in like basically as to choose what PC I buy cuz if you guys haven't watched my videos I'm just going to go through these really quick but it's from the same company called STG which is basically just like kind of budget brand that I've had a lot of PCS from they actually haven't been bad they I think that's how they kind of get really good prices is cuz they have like these kind of things they cheap out on with the PC but they get pretty good specs on them which is pretty important that's kind of the most important part but yeah the mouse honestly I'm just going to save you guys time I think it's absolutely terrible no side buttons also the sensor on it is not that good at all I'm not trying to like hate or anything and these were free so you can't complain at all technically it wasn't free it was kind of like part of the PC but yeah you guys get what I'm saying it definitely is just not worth using in my opinion at all the mouse pad is super super tiny you're I don't know who's maybe if you're playing like Roblox it will work so if you're using playing Roblox these peripherals are fine but really any other game it's going to be kind of tough again whenever I see these kind of products I just think about how much the company probably paid dude with them like getting this in bulk they probably paid like $2 or a dollar for this keyboard this thing I just really would never use it honestly feels worse than the keyboards I have at my school and they're just like random Dell or HP keyboards I will show you guys it kind of does have a little bit of RGB on it it's not super bright but you guys could see it a little bit on camera but the main focus on this PC is like the actual PC not the peripherals but it always is nice they kind of give you these as an extra I don't think these peripherals have changed at all though within the last year cuz I think I had these exact same ones since a year ago I'm not even joking yeah they looked exactly the same so it's probably the same things I honestly always hate using them I would say out of the peripherals probably the best one they give you is the keyboard but nothing in comparison to how good the PC will probably be so yeah now let's actually put together the Amazon and Teemu PC side by side and let's actually test both of them out all right so I'm going to first be testing out the Amazon PC and right now all I'm going to be doing is doing a benchmark and I'm going to do this exact same Benchmark on the teamu PC so we can compare both of them exactly okay so basically I'm just going to let it run and it will test like the CPU GPU Ram all that individually and it should give us a score at the end but recently sometimes messes up but hopefully doesn't do it this time okay so let's just see exactly what it rated everything okay this is what I'm talking about it's saying that it's missing an SSD even though I have it but we can just check like the rest of the parts so basically our Intel Pentium is kind of like I wouldn't really get one I would kind of prefer like a corai 5 or something but it says it's performing below expectations and then our RX 580 is actually performing below its potential so basically let me know if I should actually end up like tuning or optimizing these PCS so I can actually get better better performance and this is what I'm saying like for some reason it just like gives me erors like Ram not detected and like stuff like that or like SSD not detected so it's kind of weird but these are just like some random scores right over here in case uh we can compare it to the other PC okay it's probably not going to work on this PC oh no okay see this is what I'm talking about it kind of works sometimes and it kind of doesn't so it kind of gave us these are our scores for anyone that's wondering it gives us a kind of like decent gaming score and just to show you guys where it's kind of like performing here all these numbers I don't know if you guys can remember but I think the previous ones were around the 50% mark it does say it's performing below way below below expectations and stuff like that but I am 90% sure it is way like better than before and I just noticed that this PC also has two 8 GB sticks and this Amazon one only had one 16 GB stick so they both have 16 but this one has dual channel so that's definitely just going to help it and I mean this one is DDR3 so it is not going to be that fast which kind of is a little bit of a downside but let's just game with it it's going to be way better for sure okay so I'm just going to hop into my zero delay map right over here and we'll just test out real quick exactly how much fps we get like on basically a nothing creative map cuz there's basically nothing in it so we can just get a good sense of like the max FPS all right so without me even doing anything we're basically getting 200 FPS but when I move it drops a little bit down and you can see it starts having a little bit of input not input delay but it starts being like kind of laggy I'm not even going to like move any fast movement I'll just do like simple edits it drops to like 130 and look massive frame drop right there like 5 FPS and look as soon as I start like actually trying to move fast look how it's like almost it has smooth moments and then it like really just starts lagging a lot like you can see it it says 130 but you guys can see how much it's actually lagging it is not like 120 consistently so yeah that's kind of not that good because if this was actually my PC I definitely wouldn't be capping it on Unlimited I would definitely put it at like 120 or something okay so it says we're in the battle bus and you can see how much it was just lagging there so yeah it definitely is not that good right now let's just try and dude when I jump out the battle bus it's going to be lagging so bad and I know it says my internet's bad but that's literally just how it is on these trash PCS look look at this it's literally like a slideshow and keep in mind that you would have paid $400 to $450 for this PC oh there's a guy right right behind me I I literally can't do anything it's like so laggy fly away oh my God go let's go no way this guy's still no you're so weird I'm out oh my you see how laggy it is bro to be honest though I definitely did think this was going to be performing better than it actually is right now because this is kind of a big waste of money I would definitely not recommend buying this PC and it kind of sucks cuz a lot of people actually bought this PC too okay looks like there's someone trying to steal my supply drop that's nice hopefully he's not a sweat bro oh yeah there he is is he good what bro you see how much my thing is lagging oh yeah 20 what the dude this guy what oh heck no 20 oh my gosh bro come on bro he's one oh full drop dude I thought I just died you see how laggy this is oh okay finally another player right here oh no he's not an AI but he doesn't look as good dude okay this shotgun sucks bro wait I want to test this thing out yeah oh wait that only does 16 damage a bullet come on I need a laser bro oh yeah easy kill he was just like AFK I'm just going to spam these people honestly bro this thing is so op oh my gosh that just did so much damage to him dude come on AIM oh my gosh I suck bro this kid's one HP I just oh my gosh there we go oh my gosh I'm one HP this guy's going to push me like so hard oh my I tried to place a ramp bro a unlucky bro I actually just got third party so hard there were like so many kids I could have killed there too okay that PC you guys literally saw was like l like crazy but now let's actually test out the teamu PC which I I know will be so much better okay I literally just loaded in looking at the sky exactly what I did before 300 FPS so instantly way way better and here this is actually my legit first time playing so we did have a little Spike drop there uh that's my internet that that's not the PC that's actually my internet just being straight doooo dude I actually don't know why it's doing that but yeah you can see even while building I'm actually getting consistent 200 like I'm looking at the top left it's barely even going like below 200 drops a little bit dude the main thing right now is just the internet bro it ain't even the PC's fault bro the PC is fine bro it's literally the internet just being straight doooo yeah look bro I have a yellow X it's just bad okay but yeah I'm not building the best right now but it is I honestly this PC was I think an extra $30 $40 but it was still around the same price range it doesn't look as good as the Amazon one but it's like barely behind in my opinion I would just infinitely choose this PC like literally any day I don't see any reason he would choose the other PC this one for the price from teu is act like legit a PC that you should probably consider I mean dude I'm getting like 200 FPS again this is performance mode all low settings just for anyone that doesn't know okay so it's definitely going to lag a bit when I jump out the battle bus but let's see okay so while skydiving it still is laggy but you can see it is way less laggy than it was before but you can see it still is lagging like if I'm looking around moving it's frame dropping but that's just when you're skydiving it should get more consistent like pretty much like when we actually land okay this kid looks like a bot bro oh wait he hijacked the dang train bro what come on let me steal these kills what dude this kid's one HP oh I don't even know how I killed him from that far bro okay this kid lowkey doesn't look that good yeah but you can see the FPS is way better we're actually getting like 150 and it's like actually somewhat consistent okay I just I got juked out by this kid oh yeah this kid's an AI oh my dude this shotgun is like actually op I'm pushing whoever this is on the mini map with a medallion like I I'm just trying to look for some fights okay there was a kid in a car like I saw flying up over here okay yeah this kid's actually looking for Action this is the kid that killed me like a game ago I think no this kid really trying to get me to flip over right now bro bro what what happened to the car bro oh yeah oh my gosh I just lasered oh there's a kid behind me dude yes oh my there's another kid around here oh yeah he's right below me oh yeah easy bot bro no way he's camping in that cone right oh wait he's right there what the wait I didn't even know this was a burst one come on buddy no oh there we go I think they're right here oh yeah get me in there we go oh my I just domed both those kids bro they just got sat okay there we go oh yeah easy kill oh he's literally about to die right now easy this PC is actually like insane I'm not even going to lie bro this PC is actually like so good okay so I just loaded in valerant and it's more of a CPU intensive game and you can see already I'm even moving as much as I can and it is infinitely smoother like we're getting 120 FPS 140 but it's actually like Smooth we're not like frame dropping like crazy so it definitely is probably a little bit of the ram that's affecting the fortnite performance but it's definitely the graphics card cuz it's just an rx580 and fortnite definitely needs a good graphics card so even if it was a 590 it would have performed better but yeah I think the fact that it was at 580 really did not help where even are these guys oh oh you okay you guys saw how much that lagged I don't even know how I hit that shot oh he's already here what the I have negative awareness bro oh he's right down there oh wait did he he's behind me yes okay finally bro I did not want to play more okay now in valerin I know I'm in a custom game so it might be a little bit less intense on the PC but yeah we have 350 FPS and you guys can already tell like from previously the other pz was not even peaking at 300 FPS like not even close so this PC is just infinitely better like I don't even really have to test a whole valerant game on it it's just it's just way way better I literally just sat in here like trying to get a frame drop and I even haven't got like a massive frame drop even in fortnite when I was like playing the entire game the PC temperatures are good just just honestly nothing wrong with this PC especially for the price and I think you also did get like a keyboard or Mouse with that PC for free so I mean really I wouldn't consider that in the purchase but it basically is free so it's just nice that they give you that as like a nice little addition all right this is just a really random test but I basically have Minecraft on all low settings so it's literally like Max zoomed in so it's the least amount of like stress on the PC I literally just do this cuz I'm always curious but I just look up in the sky and get the max amount of FPS so we're basically maxing out at 5 to 600 yeah almost 700 over there so oh almost 800 lowkey so I'm I just do this it's kind of pointless but I just want to see how the teamu PC compares to it cuz it's kind of like a little Benchmark I do okay so I literally tried testing out Minecraft but it does not open at all I can like try again it literally just doesn't open at all so I tried opening it I don't know why it doesn't which kind of sucks but I definitely would say this PC would easily get over 1,000 FPS in Minecraft but we did mainly test it on fortnite and easily it just completely didn't better than the Amazon PC overall the results definitely did surprise me a little bit I've been saying since the beginning of the video this does have better specs so obviously it's going to perform better but this PC performs worse than I thought and this PC perform better and I'm not going to lie comparing them side by side this PC doesn't look as good as this one this one just seems like a little bit cleaner but dude I would take this one any day so yeah I will have both these PCS Linked In the description for anyone that wants them I also do have these mouse pads Linked In the description as well I have a bunch of different like colors and sizes so yeah if you guys are interested in that make sure to check them down below but as always if you did watch all the way to the end of the video first of all thank thank you cuz literally only like 10% of you guys do that but yeah you can also watch another video up on the screen and that's about it remember Jesus loves you and that's about it God bless"
